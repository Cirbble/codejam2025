    "content": "The whole $ALLO situation has been messy since listing. Most people aren’t happy with how it turned out, and honestly, I get why. The price fell more than 60% in just one day, way below what most expected after it got listed on Binance, Coinbase, OKX, KuCoin, and Bitget.\n    \n      To me, this kind of move isn’t shocking. It’s the same story that happens after almost every major listing. The hype builds, people rush in, and then airdrop holders and early investors start dumping to lock profits. ",
