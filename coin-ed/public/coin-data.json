    "content": "I've been scouting micro-cap gems on the Tron network lately, the kind with market caps under 10M that can explode if some real volume rolls in. You get it - those degenerate plays where timing is everything, but fees kill the vibe. Every swap, transfer, or contract call drains energy like crazy, and if I stake a ton of TRX to build up resources, that's capital stuck that I could use for jumping into more positions. It's frustrating when you're trying to flip quick without bleeding out on costs.",
