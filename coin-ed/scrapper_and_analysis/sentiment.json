    "title": "$MERL Is Showing Strength Amid Market Volatility, But What Could Be Next for Its Move?",
    "content": "$MERL rose 2.44% in the last 24 hours, moving ahead of the broader crypto market. I’ve been watching it after the recent volatility and it started showing some signs of stabilization. Network upgrades, new exchange support, and a short-term technical rebound all seemed to line up, but seeing it move in real time feels different from just reading charts.\n    \n      I decided to trade it on Bitget as part of the Trading Club Championship Phase 17. I’m not chasing anything, just following $MERL, making small moves, and seeing how it behaves. The extra BGB from the challenge is just part of the process, not the reason I’m trading, mostly it’s about watching how it flows in the market.\n    \n      It makes you wonder if setups like this can appear quietly, what else might be forming in the background that most people aren’t noticing?\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/merlin-chain",

    "title": "My Take on $ALLO Price Drop",
    "content": "The whole $ALLO situation has been messy since listing. Most people aren’t happy with how it turned out, and honestly, I get why. The price fell more than 60% in just one day, way below what most expected after it got listed on Binance, Coinbase, OKX, KuCoin, and Bitget.\n    \n      To me, this kind of move isn’t shocking. It’s the same story that happens after almost every major listing. The hype builds, people rush in, and then airdrop holders and early investors start dumping to lock profits. Binance alone dropped 15 million tokens to BNB holders, and most of them didn’t even wait; they just sold on sight. The result was huge trading volume and even bigger sell pressure.\n    \n      The other thing that’s making investors uneasy is the valuation. $ALLO’s fully diluted value is sitting around $600M, while its market cap is only about $115M. That’s a big gap. Only 20% of its supply is in circulation, meaning there’s still about 80% of tokens waiting to enter the market later. That future unlock alone is enough to scare new buyers.\n    \n      When you compare it to other decentralized AI projects like $FET or $RNDR, $ALLO still looks expensive for what it currently delivers. So it’s not just about the market being red, it’s about people questioning if the token is really worth that kind of FDV right now.\n    \n      The overall market mood isn’t helping either. Fear sentiment has been high, and most traders are running back to $BTC and $ETH, leaving small caps to bleed. But even with that, $ALLO’s 66% crash is still way beyond normal. It feels like the AI narrative couldn’t hold up against all the selling pressure.\n    \n      Still, I don’t see it as all bad. A lot of people are panicking, but this might actually open up a window to get in lower. I’ve been watching Bitget’s CandyBomb section, and seeing $ALLO featured there makes me think there’s still some opportunity to play around it, maybe not immediately, but when the noise settles a bit.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/allora",

    "content": "I was trading $MORI earlier today and ended up going down a bit of a rabbit hole. I have been watching the chart on bitget for a while, waiting for a decent entry, and before taking the trade I decided to double-check a few things using GetAgent. The setup looked fine, volume was building slowly, so I went in with a small position just to test how it moves in real time.\n    \n      Somewhere during that process I realized I could actually trade us stocks like tesla through the same onchain setup I was using to be part of the onchain trading competition 74. At first I thought it was just another feature hidden behind some gateway, but it wasn’t. It worked directly with no gas fees attached. That part made me pause a bit because it kind of blurs the line between traditional markets and what we’ve been doing in onchain environments.\n    \n      So for now, I’m still holding my $MORI position and tracking its movement while testing a few more of these setups quietly. I want to see how smooth the experience stays over time before I start using the same route for equities. If it holds up, it might actually be one of the simpler ways to bridge onchain and stock exposure without having to jump between platforms.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mori-coin",

    "content": "Hey all,\n    \n      I am relatively new to crypto, so I am very cautious on how I spend my money on altcoins. I am curious to know how you feel about the analysis below?\n    \n      Aviator ($AVI) just announced moving their SkyBridge V2 concept to Stratus, moving from a 'simple' bridge concept to a whole new ecosystem.\n    \n      AVI holders can convert to STRAT at $0.01 per token (implying $100M FDV), while the launch target sits around $250M FDV. With AVI currently trading around $0.0009 per token, that’s roughly a 10x implied upside on conversion.\n    \n      Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aviator\n    \n      Question:\n    \n      What’s your take on this?

    "content": "The chain is new with almost no volume yet (good thing to be this early) and it's clear Gala Games want their project to exceed. GalaDog $GDOG was the first community token that launched and bonded on their new launchpad/dex, and it also happens to be the first dog meme on a new chain. We all know what that means. Because of this and them already promoting this coin I'm willing to bet they'll pump a ton of money into this in order to try and bring people over from other ecosystems, they've already compared it saying its the next solana. I noticed the ceo launched his own coin, bene, and the same address also bought a ton of $GDOG tokens on their launchpad before it graduated to the dex. The team behind the coin are posting on twitter about some game assets theyre building and looks like they plan to do a NFT drop to holders based on their website. Take all this info and it's clear they're going to send this token.\n    \n      The token has a marketcap of 200k currently, and a 100x is only 20m marketcap. Imagine if this does the bare minimum any other chain has done for a dog coin, 200m-2b marketcap would be a 1000x-10,000x and the funniest part is it's not even unrealistic. This feels so early it's almost too good to be true but I'm thinking it's true.\n    \n      I've wrote a buying guide below, the second option you can use a debit card and its a little faster.\n    \n      Option 1:\n    \n      If you already have Metamask, buy $GALA on ethereum. Head to https://connect.gala.com/ connect your wallet and bridge your $GALA from Ethereum -> GalaChain. Once you've done that, you can click on your balances to see. It takes about 1-2 minutes. Once your $GALA is on GalaChain, go to https://swap.gala.com/GALA/GDOG and connect your wallet and swap your gala for $DOG\n    \n      Option 2:\n    \n      Head to https://connect.gala.com/?viewProduct=66a8ed9e4d218b9606182ea7 and connect your wallet. You can purchase $GALA already on GalaChain with a debit card directly to your Metamask wallet. Once you've done that, you can click on your balances to see. It takes about 1-2 minutes. Once your $GALA is on GalaChain, go to https://swap.gala.com/GALA/GDOG and connect your wallet and swap your gala for $DOG\n    \n      Note: your galachain wallet address is just your ethereum address but with \"eth|\" replacing the \"0x\" in the string of the address\n    \n      Here are their socials, check it out yourself first\n    \n      Discord: https://discord.com/invite/gz43xzqT\n    \n      Twitter: https://x.com/GalaDogCoin\n    \n      Website: https://swap.gala.com/GDOG/GALA",

    "content": "$PEP isn’t just another meme token. It’s a real Layer-1 blockchain, forked from Dogecoin and Bitcoin’s original codebase, using Proof-of-Work with its own miners and network. It’s built on the same foundation that powered BTC and DOGE, meaning it’s a fully independent chain, not a token running on another blockchain.\n    \n      Here’s why this matters 👇 Right now, $PEP’s market cap is under $40 million — absurdly low for a functioning Layer-1. •\tAt $400 Million, that’s a 10× from here. •\tAt $1B, the price would be around $0.01. •\tAt $10B, around $0.10. •\tAnd at $100B (DOGE’s peak level), $PEP would be $1. For a coin with its own network, global community, and growing exchange presence, this isn’t just fantasy, it’s math.\n    \n      What’s fueling the momentum:\n    \n      ✅ MEXC listing live — one of the biggest Tier-1 exchanges already supports PEP.\n    \n      ✅ Kraken confirmed listing — integration in progress (Layer-1 listings take time), but this is huge validation for the chain.\n    \n      ✅ More Tier-1 exchanges next — when one major exchange lists a Layer-1, others usually follow.\n    \n      The community is active worldwide, from Asia to Latin America, and marketing is ramping up fast.

    "content": "Hey Solanauts and fellow Moonshot hunters! You often see crypto projects with tokens and no real tech. Today, I'm bringing you a unique opportunity: Bejibun ($BJBN). This is a low-cap gem on Solana built to power a brand-new backend framework designed specifically for the Web3 future. The team is actively grinding, and their vision for decentralized applications (dApps) and simple blockchain payments is what could make this a genuine moonshot.\n    \n        \n      \n      The Engine: The Bejibun Framework\n    \n    \n      \n      $BJBN isn't just a random meme coin; it's the official token for the Bejibun Framework. This project has real, tangible utility in the developer world. What is it? Bejibun is a Typescript framework designed for backend development, but it runs on something truly special: the Bun Runtime. Why Bun Matters For those who don't know: Bun is the new, revolutionary JavaScript runtime (think a super-charged, next-generation Node.js killer). It’s known for its incredible speed, tiny memory footprint, and superior performance in handling concurrent tasks.\n    \n      2. The Bejibun Vision\n    \n      The developers noticed that many of today's dApps are slow because they still rely on traditional, slow backends, despite being on a fast blockchain like Solana. Bejibun fixes this. By building their framework around Bun, they are giving developers an easy-to-use, powerful toolkit that leverages the speed of Bun and is built from the ground up for native Web3 integration. The goal is to build dApps that are truly fast and fully blockchain-integrated. This isn't just a Whitepaper dream! The framework is already in pre-release with key features already implemented, including:\n    \n        \n      \n      A functioning CLI for easy project setup.\n    \n    \n      \n      Middleware support (the core of the payment system).\n    \n    \n      \n      Full Database support (Migrations, Seeders).\n    \n    \n      \n      Routing, Logging, and Redis integration for caching.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      The Killer Feature: x402 Payments\n    \n    \n      \n      Middleware (Making Crypto Easy) This is the absolute game-changer and the core utility of $BJBN's ecosystem. The team is dedicated to implementing a solution based on x402 payment trends—a new way to think about how applications handle micro-payments on-chain. The Problem They Solve: Integrating crypto payments into an application is currently a headache. It requires complex wallet connections, transaction monitoring, and boilerplate code for different chains. It's too complicated for mainstream adoption. The Bejibun Solution: Router.pay() The team is creating a simple, integrated Payment Middleware to dramatically simplify this process. They are making blockchain payments feel as simple as calling a single function inside a traditional web router.\n    \n      Imagine the simplicity for a developer who wants to accept a payment before serving content: Router.pay(\"0xaddress\", \"$0.01\", \"base-sepolia\").get(\"your-endpoint\", \"YourController@yourFunction\")\n    \n      They are researching and building this to abstract away the complexity. What does this mean for YOU? This middleware will drastically lower the entry barrier for building commercial dApps, membership sites, e-commerce stores, or any application that needs fast, seamless micro-payments on the Solana blockchain. This utility alone gives $BJBN massive long-term value.\n    \n      4. The Token: $BJBN\n    \n        \n      \n      Blockchain: SPL token on Solana. (High speed, low fees—the perfect environment).\n    \n    \n      \n      Where to Buy: The token is currently live and tradable on Pump Swap, Raydium and every other major Dexs.\n    \n    \n      \n      Security & Trust: The team has locked a massive 80 MILLION BJBN tokens using the Streamflow platform until November 2026.

    "content": "Meet $WAVE. One of the best $SOL rewards tokens out there.\n    \n      We generate consistent passive $SOL with zero hype required and infinite LP expansion plan. We live of other project’s volume.\n    \n      They moon - we collect rewards! They drop - we collect rewards!\n    \n      They do the heavy lifting and we enjoy along the way 🤓\n    \n      Our approach is creating dozens of LP pairs with other successful projects. When their price changes it stabilizes and align the pair price and sell/buy on $WAVE chart too using Arbitrage bots activity.\n    \n      4% of that volume is then translated to $SOL rewards for our beloved holders.\n    \n      More Pools = More Routing = More Volume = More Rewards 💧\n    \n      While others chase pumps, $WAVE quietly collects.\n    \n      No gimmicks. Just pure on-chain mechanics feeding rewards back to holders, 24/7.\n    \n      In a nutshell: • 💰 LP-reward token — earn $SOL just by holding • 🔁 25+ LPs live and growing — paired with promising projects like $ORE, $TROLL, $DRIP, $PANDU, and many more • ⚙️ Automated LP arbitrage = nonstop organic volume between pools • 💥 Total liquidity already doubled from LP expansions — and still climbing • 🔄 Rewards auto-flushed every few hours and used to create new LP pools (compounding, self-feeding ecosystem) • 💪 Built by the same team behind $DRIP — proven, transparent, and relentless\n    \n      CA: u3nva3iLGfoy9XgzkT7tYzAKkV2x6AkNqnukGNdFiDF\n    \n      Every new pool strengthens the network — more routing, more volume, more $SOL flowing to holders. This isn’t a token waiting for hype — it’s a machine that builds its own momentum. 🌊\n    \n      Ride the wave before everyone else sees it coming.",

    "content": "Hey everyone, just wanted to share something I stumbled on while browsing Solana projects. There’s a new meme token called $APE that’s starting to pop up across small crypto circles. It’s very early, but the community energy feels authentic... not the usual botted hype.\n    \n      Quick notes: • Ticker: $APE • Chain: Solana • Contract: GiZPKUz7sUPMRmC2sKeFywH8mL6jzpWMNrt2JNccpump\n    \n      The developer is publicly active on X (Twitter) and frequently engages with the community.”\n    \n      The team has mentioned regular supply-management updates, the website just launched, and it's yet to be listed on cg and cmc. They have big plans including creating an apeswap. Still under the radar and whales yet to get in...\n    \n      The vibe reminds me of early grassroots memes that found their own momentum. No promises, no financial talk — just observing that $APE has a fun culture and creative meme game forming fast. Might be worth watching how it evolves as Solana meme season continues. Anyone else seen this around or joined the chat yet?",

I’m talking about something that carries the weight of real relationships—people I’ve laughed with, built with, grown up with. I’ve have around 100 friends and family members who’ve put their trust in this project. That’s not just a number to me. That’s my circle. My people. And when they believe in something because I do, that means everything.\n    \n      Sure, we all want to win. Nobody’s here to lose. But for me, this isn’t just about chasing green candles. It’s about building something that holds. Something that reflects the energy, the loyalty, the culture we’ve cultivated. I’m not driven by hype—I’m driven by responsibility. By the look in someone’s eyes when they say, “I’m in because of you.” That’s not something I take lightly.\n    \n      So no, I can’t just “jeet.” I can’t rug, dip, or disappear. Not without bringing down the full force of hail, wrath, and fury from the people I care about most. And honestly? I wouldn’t want it any other way. That pressure—that accountability—is what keeps me sharp. It’s what keeps this real.\n    \n      $LING isn’t just a play. It’s a promise. A promise that we’re building with intention.

    "content": "I found $ALLO recently and it stood out because it isn’t trying to sell a dream with hype or memes. The whole idea behind ALLO is pretty straightforward: they want to make funding in crypto more transparent. Right now, grants and funding decisions usually happen quietly in the background, controlled by a few people. $ALLO is trying to move that on-chain so the community can actually see how money is being allocated and who gets funded. No secret committees, no politics, just open rules and transparent funding.\n    \n      This feels like something crypto actually needs, especially as more projects start competing for grants and ecosystem money. It’s still early, which is exactly why I’m watching it. Early usually means more upside if the idea catches on.\n    \n      $ALLO also just got listed on Bitget, and there’s a trading event happening where you can earn rewards just from trading. I tried the same event with a different token before and got rewarded without doing anything extra, I just traded like normal and the platform tracked my activity automatically. After that, the reward converted into tokens I could swap for USDT.\n    \n      No hype, no weird hoops to jump through. Just a project trying to solve a real problem, and a chance to earn a little extra while trading.\n    \n      Not financial advice, always DYOR.",

    "content": "I remember first seeing $PEP on my feed and thinking it was just another frog coin. Then I dug deeper. What started as a meme idea quietly evolved into a full-blown Layer-1 blockchain — proof-of-work, forked from Bitcoin and Dogecoin, running its own chain with fast, low-fee transactions. No bridges, no wrappers, no dependence on anyone else’s network.\n    \n      While most coins chase hype on X, the $PEP devs are actually building and promoting. They’ve been attending crypto summits, putting up real banners, and now they’re planning one of the boldest moves yet: a massive Copacabana banner in Rio from December 26 to January 4. Millions of people celebrating New Year’s Eve will see “Pepecoin.org” on one of the most famous beaches in the world.\n    \n      This isn’t a paid influencer stunt — it’s the community making noise the old-school way.  Kraken integration reportedly next. The market cap is still under $40 M, and that’s where it gets interesting.\n    \n      Coins with way less tech and no utility have reached billion-dollar valuations in past cycles. A true L1 chain with this kind of momentum doesn’t need a miracle to 100x just exposure. Every bull run has its breakout Layer-1 story. $PEP might be this cycle’s unexpected one.",
