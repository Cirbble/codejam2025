That’s why more people are paying attention to small MC projects that actually build instead of promise.\n    \n      $WAVE spent its first month focused on structure and utility.

It uses the “stay bullish” concept, bringing users together around a shared idea and degen aesthetic. $BULLISH is built on a simple framework with a recognizable narrative.\n    \n      The total supply is 1 billion tokens, offering insight into liquidity distribution and the early dynamics of the community. Being on the Solana network enables fast and low-cost transactions.\n    \n      Why $BULLISH?\n    \n      The project stands out for its focus on identity and community. $BULLISH builds its story around memeculture and degen aesthetics. User engagement and network interactions influence how the project develops and how its narrative spreads.\n    \n      Compared to other Solana memecoins, $BULLISH is simpler and easier to follow. This makes observing the community’s evolution clearer and emphasizes the cultural aspect.\n    \n      Community and Culture\n    \n      $BULLISH relies on an active community. The “degenerate” narrative lets users participate in memeculture and shape the project’s story through content sharing and discussions.

Born from the chaos of the market wreckage, built for the believers who HODL through the dips. This isn't just another token; it's a movement celebrating strength, unity, and that wild Web3 jungle energy where we all go full ape together. 🐒💥\n    \n          What's $APE All About?\n        \n        \n      \n      The Vibe: A pure community-driven meme token on Solana,  fast, cheap, and scalable AF.

    "content": "The chain is new with almost no volume yet (good thing to be this early) and it's clear Gala Games want their project to exceed. GalaDog $GDOG was the first community token that launched and bonded on their new launchpad/dex, and it also happens to be the first dog meme on a new chain. We all know what that means. Because of this and them already promoting this coin I'm willing to bet they'll pump a ton of money into this in order to try and bring people over from other ecosystems, they've already compared it saying its the next solana. I noticed the ceo launched his own coin, bene, and the same address also bought a ton of $GDOG tokens on their launchpad before it graduated to the dex. The team behind the coin are posting on twitter about some game assets theyre building and looks like they plan to do a NFT drop to holders based on their website. Take all this info and it's clear they're going to send this token.\n    \n      The token has a marketcap of 200k currently, and a 100x is only 20m marketcap. Imagine if this does the bare minimum any other chain has done for a dog coin, 200m-2b marketcap would be a 1000x-10,000x and the funniest part is it's not even unrealistic. This feels so early it's almost too good to be true but I'm thinking it's true.\n    \n      I've wrote a buying guide below, the second option you can use a debit card and its a little faster.\n    \n      Option 1:\n    \n      If you already have Metamask, buy $GALA on ethereum. Head to https://connect.gala.com/ connect your wallet and bridge your $GALA from Ethereum -> GalaChain. Once you've done that, you can click on your balances to see. It takes about 1-2 minutes. Once your $GALA is on GalaChain, go to https://swap.gala.com/GALA/GDOG and connect your wallet and swap your gala for $DOG\n    \n      Option 2:\n    \n      Head to https://connect.gala.com/?viewProduct=66a8ed9e4d218b9606182ea7 and connect your wallet. You can purchase $GALA already on GalaChain with a debit card directly to your Metamask wallet. Once you've done that, you can click on your balances to see. It takes about 1-2 minutes. Once your $GALA is on GalaChain, go to https://swap.gala.com/GALA/GDOG and connect your wallet and swap your gala for $DOG\n    \n      Note: your galachain wallet address is just your ethereum address but with \"eth|\" replacing the \"0x\" in the string of the address\n    \n      Here are their socials, check it out yourself first\n    \n      Discord: https://discord.com/invite/gz43xzqT\n    \n      Twitter: https://x.com/GalaDogCoin\n    \n      Website: https://swap.gala.com/GDOG/GALA",

    "content": "$PEP isn’t just another meme token. It’s a real Layer-1 blockchain, forked from Dogecoin and Bitcoin’s original codebase, using Proof-of-Work with its own miners and network. It’s built on the same foundation that powered BTC and DOGE, meaning it’s a fully independent chain, not a token running on another blockchain.\n    \n      Here’s why this matters 👇 Right now, $PEP’s market cap is under $40 million — absurdly low for a functioning Layer-1. •\tAt $400 Million, that’s a 10× from here. •\tAt $1B, the price would be around $0.01. •\tAt $10B, around $0.10. •\tAnd at $100B (DOGE’s peak level), $PEP would be $1. For a coin with its own network, global community, and growing exchange presence, this isn’t just fantasy, it’s math.\n    \n      What’s fueling the momentum:\n    \n      ✅ MEXC listing live — one of the biggest Tier-1 exchanges already supports PEP.\n    \n      ✅ Kraken confirmed listing — integration in progress (Layer-1 listings take time), but this is huge validation for the chain.\n    \n      ✅ More Tier-1 exchanges next — when one major exchange lists a Layer-1, others usually follow.\n    \n      The community is active worldwide, from Asia to Latin America, and marketing is ramping up fast. PEP is positioning itself as the first true “frog chain” A fusion of meme culture and real blockchain tech.\n    \n      This isn’t a meme anymore.

It’s not another meme token or forked DEX with recycled code; it’s reportedly the first patented hybrid decentralized exchange on Solana, built to solve one of DeFi’s biggest weaknesses: prevalence of rug pulls. The platform integrates on-chain stop-loss automation, rug-pull protection, and a profit-sharing system that distributes 50% of trading fees directly to BIOK holders, making them true partners in the ecosystem rather than passive investors.\n    \n      What really stands out is the credibility behind it. Biokript Pro is officially supported by Microsoft through its Founders Hub program, providing enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure and security via Microsoft Azure. On top of that, the project recently secured $100,000 in funding and technical support from Google Cloud, giving it a dual foundation of support rarely seen in the crypto world. That combination of patented technology, corporate recognition, and real utility makes Biokript Pro one of the most promising and overlooked Solana projects right now.\n    \n      With the presale ending on November 13, this could easily become the next major milestone in safe, transparent decentralized trading.\n    \n      Check it out: https://biokript.com",

The same shift that’s bringing back farmers’ markets, cold plunges, and raw milk, that’s the wave RAWW is riding.\n    \n      Where most memecoins promote gambling and degeneracy, RAWW is anti-degen to its core. It’s the first memecoin that actually stands for something real, clean living, strength, and clarity in a synthetic world.\n    \n      Why It’s Different\n    \n      • Real foundation: Live project, 10+ months old, no team sells.• Utility + culture: Clicker game, merch store ( discount for RAWW holders ) with natural-fiber drops, Webtoons, and a telegram bot• Delivery over promises: The team doesn’t “plan” to build things, they already ship.\n    \n      Still sitting at $70K MCAP, it's criminally undervalued for a project this solid, But it gives you an opportunity to buy at the absolute ground floor\n    \n      With the right marketing push? $10M+ is conservative - and that’s 150x from here\n    \n      Why Now?\n    \n      RAWW just entered Phase 3, the marketing + influencer partnership phase.This is when things usually explode for real projects.\n    \n      They’ve been laying low, building quietly, and now it’s go-time.We’ve all seen how coins like Ponke and Pepe went from small caps to hundreds of millions once the narrative hit.RAWW is sitting right where those were before their first real run.\n    \n      Bottom line:This could be the lifetime moonshot once the narrative catches, and it’s one that’s actually backed by something real.\n    \n      If you’re tired of the same recycled casino tokens, keep an eye on RAWW.Because the next big meme trend won’t be “degen.”It’ll be real.\n    \n      Linktree: https://linktr.ee/RAWWMilkCrypto",

    "title": "Here's $BJBN: A Solana Token Backing an innovative New Web3 Framework! (Powered by Bun Runtime & Implementing Next-Gen Payments)",
    "content": "Hey Solanauts and fellow Moonshot hunters! You often see crypto projects with tokens and no real tech. Today, I'm bringing you a unique opportunity: Bejibun ($BJBN). This is a low-cap gem on Solana built to power a brand-new backend framework designed specifically for the Web3 future. The team is actively grinding, and their vision for decentralized applications (dApps) and simple blockchain payments is what could make this a genuine moonshot.\n    \n        \n      \n      The Engine: The Bejibun Framework\n    \n    \n      \n      $BJBN isn't just a random meme coin; it's the official token for the Bejibun Framework. This project has real, tangible utility in the developer world. What is it? Bejibun is a Typescript framework designed for backend development, but it runs on something truly special: the Bun Runtime. Why Bun Matters For those who don't know: Bun is the new, revolutionary JavaScript runtime (think a super-charged, next-generation Node.js killer). It’s known for its incredible speed, tiny memory footprint, and superior performance in handling concurrent tasks.\n    \n      2. The Bejibun Vision\n    \n      The developers noticed that many of today's dApps are slow because they still rely on traditional, slow backends, despite being on a fast blockchain like Solana. Bejibun fixes this. By building their framework around Bun, they are giving developers an easy-to-use, powerful toolkit that leverages the speed of Bun and is built from the ground up for native Web3 integration. The goal is to build dApps that are truly fast and fully blockchain-integrated. This isn't just a Whitepaper dream! The framework is already in pre-release with key features already implemented, including:\n    \n        \n      \n      A functioning CLI for easy project setup.\n    \n    \n      \n      Middleware support (the core of the payment system).\n    \n    \n      \n      Full Database support (Migrations, Seeders).\n    \n    \n      \n      Routing, Logging, and Redis integration for caching.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      The Killer Feature: x402 Payments\n    \n    \n      \n      Middleware (Making Crypto Easy) This is the absolute game-changer and the core utility of $BJBN's ecosystem. The team is dedicated to implementing a solution based on x402 payment trends—a new way to think about how applications handle micro-payments on-chain. The Problem They Solve: Integrating crypto payments into an application is currently a headache. It requires complex wallet connections, transaction monitoring, and boilerplate code for different chains. It's too complicated for mainstream adoption. The Bejibun Solution: Router.pay() The team is creating a simple, integrated Payment Middleware to dramatically simplify this process. They are making blockchain payments feel as simple as calling a single function inside a traditional web router.\n    \n      Imagine the simplicity for a developer who wants to accept a payment before serving content: Router.pay(\"0xaddress\", \"$0.01\", \"base-sepolia\").get(\"your-endpoint\", \"YourController@yourFunction\")\n    \n      They are researching and building this to abstract away the complexity. What does this mean for YOU? This middleware will drastically lower the entry barrier for building commercial dApps, membership sites, e-commerce stores, or any application that needs fast, seamless micro-payments on the Solana blockchain. This utility alone gives $BJBN massive long-term value.\n    \n      4. The Token: $BJBN\n    \n        \n      \n      Blockchain: SPL token on Solana. (High speed, low fees—the perfect environment).\n    \n    \n      \n      Where to Buy: The token is currently live and tradable on Pump Swap, Raydium and every other major Dexs.\n    \n    \n      \n      Security & Trust: The team has locked a massive 80 MILLION BJBN tokens using the Streamflow platform until November 2026. This is a huge sign of commitment and stability, showing they are here for the long haul.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Roadmap & Call to Action\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Active Development: The team is constantly pushing code (check their GitHub activity!). They are also working on CSRF/XSS protection, new command structures, and their own ORM.\n    \n    \n      \n      DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH (DYOR)! This is your chance to get in early on a token that has genuine, powerful tech utility built for the future of Web3. Join the community, follow the development, and feel the speed.

    "title": "The Future of TassHub",
    "content": "buckle up, let's talk about TassHub, the under-the-radar powerhouse that's set to flip the creator economy on its head. Built on Solana's lightning-fast blockchain, TassHub isn't just another platform it's a censorship-resistant universe where creators own their content, monetize without middlemen, and build real communities. With the creator economy projected to explode to $480 billion by 2027, TassHub is positioning itself as the Web3 gateway for the next wave of digital makers. Here's why its future looks bright.\n    \n      The Foundation.Creator-First, Decentralized Freedom TassHub launched in early 2025 as a OnlyFans kind of marketplace, now it moved over to Freedom for all creators, Crypto, Health, NSFW, SFW, in the future it will be empowering creators with tools like AI-assisted content creation, captioning, and analytics, all without the algorithmic shackles of Web2 giants.\n    \n      No more getting demonetized or shadowbanned, everything's Cnft, and will be on-chain, transparent, and resistant to censorship. The platform's whitepaper nails it,  It's a \"creator-first, censorship-resistant content universe\" riding Solana's scalability.\n    \n      Looking ahead, TassHub's open-source code and doxxed dev team signal longevity.\n    \n      As Solana adoption surges, with institutions like Western Union jumping in TassHub could become the go-to hub for Web3 creators fleeing centralized platforms. Imagine seamless integrations with Solana's DeFi ecosystem, where creators stake\n    \n      tokens for passive income from a DAO? or use referrals to earn 1% lifetime revenue from their network.\n    \n      That's not hype, it's sustainable growth baked in.\n    \n      Explosive Growth, Token skyrocketed 484% in just 24 hours after Launch, hitting market caps in the six figures and drawing in creators globally.  The platform growth are Exploding and crossing the 560+ users as im writing.\n    \n      \n    \n      Recent X buzz shows user growth doubling in a month, creators onboarded and active communities hyping its utility.\n    \n      The future?\n    \n      As Solana's creator tools evolve, TassHub could integrate similar primitives, letting creators launch tokenized content or NFTs with zero fees.\n    \n      Partnerships, like the one with Ziggy Zeigler, Jordanna Fox, VCAdam, Mystic, and Missnvus, for Web3 monetization, hint at expansions into Music, Art, Crypto, and NSFW, and even IRL events.\n    \n      With Solana's low-cost transactions, TassHub scales effortlessly, potentially onboarding millions as the chain hits mainstream.Solana's Edge in the Creator Economy. Solana isn't just fast, it's the perfect backbone for a $480B+ creator boom.\n    \n      TassHub fits right in, offering a decentralized alternative where creators monetize depth over virality, as Solana itself highlighted.And onboarding a Fiat on/off ramp, gives TassHub the advantage to scale globally!\n    \n      By 2026-2027, i expect TassHub to lead in \"Creator Capital Markets\" personal brands, enabling instant payouts, and fostering communities.Solana's advantages (near-zero fees, high throughput) will outpace rivals like Base, drawing creators who want ownership without 30% cuts.\n    \n      TassHub's referral system and community rewards could create viral flywheels, turning users into stakeholders.\n    \n      Challenges and the Road Ahead.\n    \n      No project's perfect, early volatility and NSFW risks from open platforms are real, as seen in broader Solana metas.\n    \n      But TassHub's focus on utility over hype, plus Solana Colosseum participation, positions it for moonshots.\n    \n      enhanced onboarding, supercharged AI tools, and cross-chain bridges to capture more of the creator pie.\n    \n      Final Thoughts.\n    \n      Why Bet on TassHub Now?\n    \n      The creator economy's shifting to Web3, and TassHub on Solana is the dark horse ready to lead. It's not about chasing views it's about owning your narrative, earning passively, and building in a free ecosystem. If you're a creator, jump in at\n    \n      .

    "title": "Not All Innovation Comes from Tokens, Sometimes It’s the Exchanges Themselves",
    "content": "Crypto exchanges have quietly become one of the strongest backbones of the entire ecosystem, They’ve moved far beyond being just trading hubs now acting as liquidity providers, innovation labs, and in some cases, infrastructure builders for new financial primitives. From launching tokenized assets to integrating AI-driven tools and compliance frameworks, exchanges have shaped how users interact with crypto in ways most of us take for granted.\n    \n      But as innovation grew, a problem also emerged: most platforms could only excel in two areas out of three, security, accessibility, and variety. You could get an exchange that’s easy to use but lacks real depth in supported assets, or one with advanced products but clunky and risky systems. Balancing all three seemed almost impossible.\n    \n      Noticing Bitget’s recent win at the 2025 Global Fintech Awards got my attention, looking at how they have been around long enough to show consistency, and their UEX concept seems like an attempt to break that impossible triangle, I’ve been using it since before UEX was even an idea, and the shift is noticeable, trading crypto, tokenized assets, and using on chain tools now feels smoother and more connected, Whether others will copy the approach or redefine it further is what I’m really curious to see. Time will tell.\n    \n      May be next moonshot wont be another meme token, may be its an exchange finally living up to the memes about innovation we've been making for years.",

    "content": "Hey everyone, just wanted to share something I stumbled on while browsing Solana projects. There’s a new meme token called $APE that’s starting to pop up across small crypto circles. It’s very early, but the community energy feels authentic... not the usual botted hype.\n    \n      Quick notes: • Ticker: $APE • Chain: Solana • Contract: GiZPKUz7sUPMRmC2sKeFywH8mL6jzpWMNrt2JNccpump\n    \n      The developer is publicly active on X (Twitter) and frequently engages with the community.”\n    \n      The team has mentioned regular supply-management updates, the website just launched, and it's yet to be listed on cg and cmc. They have big plans including creating an apeswap. Still under the radar and whales yet to get in...\n    \n      The vibe reminds me of early grassroots memes that found their own momentum. No promises, no financial talk — just observing that $APE has a fun culture and creative meme game forming fast. Might be worth watching how it evolves as Solana meme season continues. Anyone else seen this around or joined the chat yet?",

The whole idea behind ALLO is pretty straightforward: they want to make funding in crypto more transparent. Right now, grants and funding decisions usually happen quietly in the background, controlled by a few people. $ALLO is trying to move that on-chain so the community can actually see how money is being allocated and who gets funded. No secret committees, no politics, just open rules and transparent funding.\n    \n      This feels like something crypto actually needs, especially as more projects start competing for grants and ecosystem money.

After that, the reward converted into tokens I could swap for USDT.\n    \n      No hype, no weird hoops to jump through.

No bridges, no wrappers, no dependence on anyone else’s network.\n    \n      While most coins chase hype on X, the $PEP devs are actually building and promoting. They’ve been attending crypto summits, putting up real banners, and now they’re planning one of the boldest moves yet: a massive Copacabana banner in Rio from December 26 to January 4. Millions of people celebrating New Year’s Eve will see “Pepecoin.org” on one of the most famous beaches in the world.\n    \n      This isn’t a paid influencer stunt — it’s the community making noise the old-school way.  Kraken integration reportedly next. The market cap is still under $40 M, and that’s where it gets interesting.\n    \n      Coins with way less tech and no utility have reached billion-dollar valuations in past cycles.

Those trades generate real on-chain activity and rewards that flow directly to holders in SOL.\n    \n      The idea is simple. More pools mean more movement, more movement means more volume, and that means more rewards for everyone holding. Over time this creates a compounding effect where the system strengthens itself.\n    \n      The team behind $WAVE has already proven they can build lasting projects with $DRIP, which continues to run strong and reward holders every day. $WAVE expands on that foundation with a more dynamic structure that focuses on continuous volume and compounding rewards.\n    \n      This is still the beginning. The tech is working, the pools are being optimized daily, and the community is slowly forming around the idea of creating something that lasts. If you like projects built on real mechanisms instead of promises, $WAVE is worth looking at. 🌊\n    \n      CA: u3nva3iLGfoy9XgzkT7tYzAKkV2x6AkNqnukGNdFiDF",

Every cycle, one coin comes out of nowhere and surprises everyone.

Episode 1, titled “When the lights turned red,” is now live across all major platforms (YouTube, TikTok, X, Instagram).\n    \n      For those who don’t know yet — $THC isn’t just a meme coin. It’s a culture-driven, narrative-powered project centered around one key figure: Greg is a paranoid, bunker-dwelling character who sees signals the rest of the world ignores.\n    \n      We use story and satire to build community and engagement around $THC. This isn’t just about charts or quick gains it’s about creating a universe where holders are part of a movement. Where creativity, identity and entertainment collide with the power of Web3.\n    \n      The Greg Files is our anchor. Each episode continues to build out the mythos of Greg, his conspiracies, and the world he’s trying to decode. If you’ve been following us, you’ll notice how deep this rabbit hole goes.\n    \n      Why this matters for crypto: In a market flooded with clones and hype tokens, $THC is pushing forward with a narrative-first approach. We’re not fighting for a trend we’re building a lasting identity that can grow beyond crypto-native spaces.\n    \n      We believe the future of Web3 is not just financial - it’s cultural. Projects that can blend entertainment, storytelling and community will be the ones people remember. That’s what $THC is aiming for.\n    \n      Watch Episode 1:  “When the lights turned red”\n    \n      -> https://linktr.ee/TinfoilHatComm\n    \n      If you’ve been watching us, now’s a great time to lean in.

    "title": "My Take on $ALLO Price Drop",
    "content": "The whole $ALLO situation has been messy since listing. Most people aren’t happy with how it turned out, and honestly, I get why. The price fell more than 60% in just one day, way below what most expected after it got listed on Binance, Coinbase, OKX, KuCoin, and Bitget.\n    \n      To me, this kind of move isn’t shocking. It’s the same story that happens after almost every major listing. The hype builds, people rush in, and then airdrop holders and early investors start dumping to lock profits. Binance alone dropped 15 million tokens to BNB holders, and most of them didn’t even wait; they just sold on sight. The result was huge trading volume and even bigger sell pressure.\n    \n      The other thing that’s making investors uneasy is the valuation. $ALLO’s fully diluted value is sitting around $600M, while its market cap is only about $115M. That’s a big gap. Only 20% of its supply is in circulation, meaning there’s still about 80% of tokens waiting to enter the market later. That future unlock alone is enough to scare new buyers.\n    \n      When you compare it to other decentralized AI projects like $FET or $RNDR, $ALLO still looks expensive for what it currently delivers. So it’s not just about the market being red, it’s about people questioning if the token is really worth that kind of FDV right now.\n    \n      The overall market mood isn’t helping either. Fear sentiment has been high, and most traders are running back to $BTC and $ETH, leaving small caps to bleed. But even with that, $ALLO’s 66% crash is still way beyond normal. It feels like the AI narrative couldn’t hold up against all the selling pressure.\n    \n      Still, I don’t see it as all bad. A lot of people are panicking, but this might actually open up a window to get in lower. I’ve been watching Bitget’s CandyBomb section, and seeing $ALLO featured there makes me think there’s still some opportunity to play around it, maybe not immediately, but when the noise settles a bit.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/allora",

I have been watching the chart on bitget for a while, waiting for a decent entry, and before taking the trade I decided to double-check a few things using GetAgent. The setup looked fine, volume was building slowly, so I went in with a small position just to test how it moves in real time.\n    \n      Somewhere during that process I realized I could actually trade us stocks like tesla through the same onchain setup I was using to be part of the onchain trading competition 74. At first I thought it was just another feature hidden behind some gateway, but it wasn’t. It worked directly with no gas fees attached. That part made me pause a bit because it kind of blurs the line between traditional markets and what we’ve been doing in onchain environments.\n    \n      So for now, I’m still holding my $MORI position and tracking its movement while testing a few more of these setups quietly. I want to see how smooth the experience stays over time before I start using the same route for equities. If it holds up, it might actually be one of the simpler ways to bridge onchain and stock exposure without having to jump between platforms.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mori-coin",

    "title": "$MMT Just Pulled Off One of the Biggest Pumps I’ve Seen This Year",
    "content": "$MMT just pulled off one of the biggest pumps I’ve seen this year, Before the listing, I asked GetAgent for some early positioning strategies for Momentum Finance $MMT, and it suggested going in with 50% allocation while keeping 25% on reserve in case of a pullback, I decided to follow that plan even though I wasn’t sure how big the move would be.\n    \n      A few hours later, $MMT went absolutely wild,  it pumped nearly 800%+, Watching it play out in real time felt unreal, especially knowing I had already positioned early. That one call alone made me realize how important it is to have data driven guidance in this space.\n    \n      Using bitget GetAgent’s insight and trading it really showed me how AI can give traders a serious edge, Sometimes all it takes is the right setup and timing to turn a small position into something huge.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/momentum-token/",

    "content": "“Today was a big learning day for me. I spent hours researching how tokens actually work behind the scenes — not the hype part, the real mechanics.\n    \n      Here’s what I understood:\n    \n      🔹 Market Cap = Price × Total Supply This decides how big a coin really is. A coin isn’t “cheap” just because the price is low — the supply matters more.\n    \n      🔹 Liquidity is the lifeline of a coin If a coin has low liquidity, people can’t buy or sell easily. It becomes unstable. Good projects always have strong liquidity pools.\n    \n      🔹 Token Supply is a strategic decision Should it be:\n    \n      1 billion?\n    \n      1 trillion?\n    \n      420 million? 😆 Supply affects price psychology and community interest.\n    \n      🔹 Launch platforms matter SOL, ETH, BNB — each blockchain has different fees, rules, and communities. Still researching which one is best for my coin.\n    \n      🔹 Creating a token is easy… but maintaining it is the real challenge Utility, trust, community, liquidity — all these matter more than launching.\n    \n      I’m not rushing. I’m learning the foundation properly. If I understand the basics right, I can build something real later.”",

    "title": "🔥 LET THEM COOK: The Three Builders Behind Pump.fun Are Changing the Game for the People in the Trenches",
    "content": "Here’s the thing most people get wrong about Pump.fun:\n    \n      They keep trying to attach the entire movement to one name — one founder, one decision-maker, one hero to point at. But that’s not the truth. Pump.fun isn’t one man’s masterpiece.\n    \n      It’s a three-person rebellion.\n    \n      Three builders — Alon Cohen, Dylan Kerler, and Noah Tweedale — all young, all hungry, all shaped by the same fire — decided they were done with crypto being a playground for VCs, insiders, and polished pretenders.\n    \n      And together? They built the only platform I’ve seen in years that actually gives a damn about the people in the trenches.\n    \n      ⸻\n    \n      🧩 These guys didn’t come from Silicon Valley privilege — they came from the chaos\n    \n      Let’s be honest:\n    \n      None of these three founders grew up cushioned from the mess. None of them learned crypto from think tanks or corporate advisory boards.\n    \n      They learned it in the dirt, the same place the rest of us did: •\tDealing with scam coins •\tGetting blindsided by rug pulls •\tWatching influencers pump garbage •\tPraying a 2x would save rent •\tLearning hard lessons with real money on the line\n    \n      Dylan’s early crypto history made headlines — and not in a flattering way. Teenage mistakes, hype coins, abandoned projects… the whole wild cycle.\n    \n      People gossip about it. People point fingers. People pretend they’re above it.\n    \n      But I’ll tell you right now:\n    \n      Anyone who’s been in crypto since 2017 knows exactly how easy it was to get pulled into that shit.\n    \n      People forget: These founders weren’t masterminds back then. They were kids in the same trenches the rest of us were suffocating in.\n    \n      And you know what? Mistakes make you sharper. They show you exactly where the system cheats people. They show you what not to build.\n    \n      These three didn’t hide from the past — they built the solution they wished existed back then.\n    \n      ⸻\n    \n      💥 Pump.fun isn’t a platform — it’s a correction\n    \n      Alon brought the product intuition. Dylan brought the bleeding-edge crypto instincts (both the good and the hard-learned). Noah brought the infrastructure mind that turned chaos into a scalable system.\n    \n      Together, they created something crypto desperately needed:\n    \n      A place where regular people — not elites — can build, trade, create, and maybe finally catch a real break.\n    \n      They built a system where: •\tCreators get paid instead of preyed on •\tFees get pushed back into the ecosystem •\tTransparency replaces manipulation •\tCommunity takeovers keep dead projects alive •\tRevenue gets shared •\tThe platform eats last\n    \n      That wasn’t an accident. That was design.\n    \n      These three knew what retail grinders were going through because they had lived that life themselves — raw, broke, and experimenting like the rest of us.\n    \n      ⸻\n    \n      🔥 Redistribution isn’t charity — it’s philosophy\n    \n      Here’s what I respect about this trio:\n    \n      They didn’t try to “protect retail” by condescending to us. They didn’t try to act like saviors. They didn’t show up with lectures and “sustainable models” and regulatory jargon.\n    \n      They showed up and said:\n    \n      “What if we actually paid the people doing the work?”\n    \n      And then they did something no other platform in crypto history has done:\n    \n      They engineered a creator economy where being small is not a disadvantage — it’s the entire point.\n    \n      The payouts? The creator fees? The revenue share? The buybacks?\n    \n      That’s not corporate generosity. That’s not PR.\n    \n      That’s a group of founders who remember the pain of grinding for nothing — and built a system to flip the hierarchy.\n    \n      ⸻\n    \n      🌪️ The airdrop hype misses the bigger revolution\n    \n      People keep talking about the airdrop like it’s the whole story: “How big will it be?” “What tier am I in?” “Will I make it?”\n    \n      But you know what the real story is?\n    \n      Three builders decided to hand the keys of crypto wealth back to the people actually showing up.\n    \n      And the trenches needed that. Badly.\n    \n      Because most of us — especially the ones doing millions in volume with nothing but scars to show for it — haven’t had a win in a long damn time.\n    \n      Pump.fun isn’t just airdrops. It’s a redistribution of opportunity.\n    \n      A new meta. A new culture. A new way of saying:\n    \n      “If you’re willing to work, you deserve a shot too.”\n    \n      ⸻\n    \n      🌞 The trenches finally have a team building for them\n    \n      This trio isn’t perfect. They’ve made mistakes. They’ve taken heat. They’ve had to grow up publicly in a market that eats founders alive.\n    \n      But they never stopped building. They never stopped innovating. They never stopped funneling value back into the ecosystem.\n    \n      And they damn sure never forgot what it feels like to be broke, hungry, and praying for one good coin to turn your life around.\n    \n      That’s why I believe in what they’re doing. That’s why I keep building. That’s why I still see hope.\n    \n      Because for the first time in a long time, the crypto world has founders who aren’t looking down on the trenches — they came from the trenches.\n    \n      So let them cook. Let them experiment. Let them reshape this landscape brick by brick.\n    \n      And if you’re reading this from the bottom — wallet scarred, hopes dented, lessons expensive —\n    \n      know this: There are builders out there designing a system for people like us. And they’re cooking something the whole industry will feel.",
