    "title": "$MERL Is Showing Strength Amid Market Volatility, But What Could Be Next for Its Move?",
    "content": "$MERL rose 2.44% in the last 24 hours, moving ahead of the broader crypto market. I’ve been watching it after the recent volatility and it started showing some signs of stabilization. Network upgrades, new exchange support, and a short-term technical rebound all seemed to line up, but seeing it move in real time feels different from just reading charts.\n    \n      I decided to trade it on Bitget as part of the Trading Club Championship Phase 17. I’m not chasing anything, just following $MERL, making small moves, and seeing how it behaves. The extra BGB from the challenge is just part of the process, not the reason I’m trading, mostly it’s about watching how it flows in the market.\n    \n      It makes you wonder if setups like this can appear quietly, what else might be forming in the background that most people aren’t noticing?\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/merlin-chain",

    "content": "PEP isn’t built like a typical meme coin. It’s a full Layer-1 chain with real infrastructure, real mining, and real developers behind it, including a Dogecoin dev who joined the project because they genuinely believed in the idea and direction of the chain. That already puts PEP in a completely different category from the usual low-effort launches.\n    \n      The market cap is still extremely low for an L1 with active development, merge-mining, global marketing pushes, and growing community demand. Historically, early-stage Layer-1s with working PoW security have gone on to hit multibillion-dollar valuations during strong alt seasons. With PEP still far below that range, the upside to $1 and even pushing toward $10 isn’t some delusional moon math, it’s just what happens when liquidity finally rotates into undervalued L1 chains that actually have something built.\n    \n      PEP is merge-mined with Dogecoin and Litecoin, which gives it inherited network security from two established PoW chains. That’s a massive advantage almost no low-cap project can replicate. Add the low fees, fast transactions, and constant builder activity, and suddenly you have one of the few L1s that actually looks early rather than exhausted.\n    \n      The difference with PEP is simple: it has an active dev with real Doge history, a working chain, a low cap, and an expanding exchange presence. That combination is extremely rare in this cycle. If you’re looking for a project that isn’t just hype but has genuine room to grow into the billion-dollar range, PEP is one of the last remaining undervalued L1 plays with that kind of runway.\n    \n      Website: pepecoin.com / pepecoin.org\n    \n      Ticker: $PEP",

    "content": "Hey r/cryptomoonshots fam! 👋 If you're tired of the same old rugs and looking for a fresh meme play with real community fire, strap in – $APE (Ape Coin on Solana) is here to remind us why we ape into crypto in the first place. Born from the chaos of the market wreckage, built for the believers who HODL through the dips. This isn't just another token; it's a movement celebrating strength, unity, and that wild Web3 jungle energy where we all go full ape together. 🐒💥\n    \n          What's $APE All About?\n        \n        \n      \n      The Vibe: A pure community-driven meme token on Solana,  fast, cheap, and scalable AF. No BS utility promises, just straight-up fun, memes, and the power of the pack. Think Bored Apes meets Solana speed: holders unite, memes drop, and we pump the culture.\n    \n    \n      \n      Why Now? Ultra-low entry with a market cap under $500K (as of recent checks... DYOR, it's pumping already!). Volume's heating up, and with Solana's ecosystem exploding, $APE is positioned for that next viral wave. Early apes are already stacking, don't get rekt FOMOing in later.\n    \n    \n      \n          Token Deets (Keep It Simple, Apes)\n        \n        \n      \n      Symbol: $APE\n    \n    \n      \n      Contract Address: GiZPKUz7sUPMRmC2sKeFywH8mL6jzpWMNrt2JNccpump (Always verify on DEX – safety first!)\n    \n    \n      \n      Tokenomics: Deflationary burns incoming – short-term target of 10% supply torched to keep the fire lit.

    "title": "Why you should buy the first Gala Dog memecoin on GalaChain - $GDOG",
    "content": "The chain is new with almost no volume yet (good thing to be this early) and it's clear Gala Games want their project to exceed. GalaDog $GDOG was the first community token that launched and bonded on their new launchpad/dex, and it also happens to be the first dog meme on a new chain. We all know what that means. Because of this and them already promoting this coin I'm willing to bet they'll pump a ton of money into this in order to try and bring people over from other ecosystems, they've already compared it saying its the next solana. I noticed the ceo launched his own coin, bene, and the same address also bought a ton of $GDOG tokens on their launchpad before it graduated to the dex. The team behind the coin are posting on twitter about some game assets theyre building and looks like they plan to do a NFT drop to holders based on their website. Take all this info and it's clear they're going to send this token.\n    \n      The token has a marketcap of 200k currently, and a 100x is only 20m marketcap. Imagine if this does the bare minimum any other chain has done for a dog coin, 200m-2b marketcap would be a 1000x-10,000x and the funniest part is it's not even unrealistic. This feels so early it's almost too good to be true but I'm thinking it's true.\n    \n      I've wrote a buying guide below, the second option you can use a debit card and its a little faster.\n    \n      Option 1:\n    \n      If you already have Metamask, buy $GALA on ethereum. Head to https://connect.gala.com/ connect your wallet and bridge your $GALA from Ethereum -> GalaChain. Once you've done that, you can click on your balances to see. It takes about 1-2 minutes. Once your $GALA is on GalaChain, go to https://swap.gala.com/GALA/GDOG and connect your wallet and swap your gala for $DOG\n    \n      Option 2:\n    \n      Head to https://connect.gala.com/?viewProduct=66a8ed9e4d218b9606182ea7 and connect your wallet. You can purchase $GALA already on GalaChain with a debit card directly to your Metamask wallet. Once you've done that, you can click on your balances to see. It takes about 1-2 minutes. Once your $GALA is on GalaChain, go to https://swap.gala.com/GALA/GDOG and connect your wallet and swap your gala for $DOG\n    \n      Note: your galachain wallet address is just your ethereum address but with \"eth|\" replacing the \"0x\" in the string of the address\n    \n      Here are their socials, check it out yourself first\n    \n      Discord: https://discord.com/invite/gz43xzqT\n    \n      Twitter: https://x.com/GalaDogCoin\n    \n      Website: https://swap.gala.com/GDOG/GALA",

    "title": "$PEP — The Frog Mineable/Layer-1 aiming for $1 first… then $10 🐸",
    "content": "$PEP isn’t just another meme token. It’s a real Layer-1 blockchain, forked from Dogecoin and Bitcoin’s original codebase, using Proof-of-Work with its own miners and network. It’s built on the same foundation that powered BTC and DOGE, meaning it’s a fully independent chain, not a token running on another blockchain.\n    \n      Here’s why this matters 👇 Right now, $PEP’s market cap is under $40 million — absurdly low for a functioning Layer-1. •\tAt $400 Million, that’s a 10× from here. •\tAt $1B, the price would be around $0.01. •\tAt $10B, around $0.10. •\tAnd at $100B (DOGE’s peak level), $PEP would be $1. For a coin with its own network, global community, and growing exchange presence, this isn’t just fantasy, it’s math.\n    \n      What’s fueling the momentum:\n    \n      ✅ MEXC listing live — one of the biggest Tier-1 exchanges already supports PEP.\n    \n      ✅ Kraken confirmed listing — integration in progress (Layer-1 listings take time), but this is huge validation for the chain.\n    \n      ✅ More Tier-1 exchanges next — when one major exchange lists a Layer-1, others usually follow.\n    \n      The community is active worldwide, from Asia to Latin America, and marketing is ramping up fast. PEP is positioning itself as the first true “frog chain” A fusion of meme culture and real blockchain tech.\n    \n      This isn’t a meme anymore. It’s a movement — and it’s still early. 🐸\n    \n      Website: pepecoin.com / pepecoin.org Ticker: $PEP",

    "title": "Here's $BJBN: A Solana Token Backing an innovative New Web3 Framework! (Powered by Bun Runtime & Implementing Next-Gen Payments)",
    "content": "Hey Solanauts and fellow Moonshot hunters! You often see crypto projects with tokens and no real tech. Today, I'm bringing you a unique opportunity: Bejibun ($BJBN). This is a low-cap gem on Solana built to power a brand-new backend framework designed specifically for the Web3 future. The team is actively grinding, and their vision for decentralized applications (dApps) and simple blockchain payments is what could make this a genuine moonshot.\n    \n        \n      \n      The Engine: The Bejibun Framework\n    \n    \n      \n      $BJBN isn't just a random meme coin; it's the official token for the Bejibun Framework. This project has real, tangible utility in the developer world. What is it? Bejibun is a Typescript framework designed for backend development, but it runs on something truly special: the Bun Runtime. Why Bun Matters For those who don't know: Bun is the new, revolutionary JavaScript runtime (think a super-charged, next-generation Node.js killer). It’s known for its incredible speed, tiny memory footprint, and superior performance in handling concurrent tasks.\n    \n      2. The Bejibun Vision\n    \n      The developers noticed that many of today's dApps are slow because they still rely on traditional, slow backends, despite being on a fast blockchain like Solana. Bejibun fixes this. By building their framework around Bun, they are giving developers an easy-to-use, powerful toolkit that leverages the speed of Bun and is built from the ground up for native Web3 integration. The goal is to build dApps that are truly fast and fully blockchain-integrated. This isn't just a Whitepaper dream! The framework is already in pre-release with key features already implemented, including:\n    \n        \n      \n      A functioning CLI for easy project setup.\n    \n    \n      \n      Middleware support (the core of the payment system).\n    \n    \n      \n      Full Database support (Migrations, Seeders).\n    \n    \n      \n      Routing, Logging, and Redis integration for caching.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      The Killer Feature: x402 Payments\n    \n    \n      \n      Middleware (Making Crypto Easy) This is the absolute game-changer and the core utility of $BJBN's ecosystem. The team is dedicated to implementing a solution based on x402 payment trends—a new way to think about how applications handle micro-payments on-chain. The Problem They Solve: Integrating crypto payments into an application is currently a headache. It requires complex wallet connections, transaction monitoring, and boilerplate code for different chains. It's too complicated for mainstream adoption. The Bejibun Solution: Router.pay() The team is creating a simple, integrated Payment Middleware to dramatically simplify this process. They are making blockchain payments feel as simple as calling a single function inside a traditional web router.\n    \n      Imagine the simplicity for a developer who wants to accept a payment before serving content: Router.pay(\"0xaddress\", \"$0.01\", \"base-sepolia\").get(\"your-endpoint\", \"YourController@yourFunction\")\n    \n      They are researching and building this to abstract away the complexity. What does this mean for YOU? This middleware will drastically lower the entry barrier for building commercial dApps, membership sites, e-commerce stores, or any application that needs fast, seamless micro-payments on the Solana blockchain. This utility alone gives $BJBN massive long-term value.\n    \n      4. The Token: $BJBN\n    \n        \n      \n      Blockchain: SPL token on Solana. (High speed, low fees—the perfect environment).\n    \n    \n      \n      Where to Buy: The token is currently live and tradable on Pump Swap, Raydium and every other major Dexs.\n    \n    \n      \n      Security & Trust: The team has locked a massive 80 MILLION BJBN tokens using the Streamflow platform until November 2026. This is a huge sign of commitment and stability, showing they are here for the long haul.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Roadmap & Call to Action\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Active Development: The team is constantly pushing code (check their GitHub activity!). They are also working on CSRF/XSS protection, new command structures, and their own ORM.\n    \n    \n      \n      DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH (DYOR)! This is your chance to get in early on a token that has genuine, powerful tech utility built for the future of Web3. Join the community, follow the development, and feel the speed.

It’s very early, but the community energy feels authentic... not the usual botted hype.\n    \n      Quick notes: • Ticker: $APE • Chain: Solana • Contract: GiZPKUz7sUPMRmC2sKeFywH8mL6jzpWMNrt2JNccpump\n    \n      The developer is publicly active on X (Twitter) and frequently engages with the community.”\n    \n      The team has mentioned regular supply-management updates, the website just launched, and it's yet to be listed on cg and cmc. They have big plans including creating an apeswap. Still under the radar and whales yet to get in...\n    \n      The vibe reminds me of early grassroots memes that found their own momentum. No promises, no financial talk — just observing that $APE has a fun culture and creative meme game forming fast. Might be worth watching how it evolves as Solana meme season continues. Anyone else seen this around or joined the chat yet?",

    "content": "When I talk about $LING, I’m not just talking about a token. I’m talking about something that carries the weight of real relationships—people I’ve laughed with, built with, grown up with. I’ve have around 100 friends and family members who’ve put their trust in this project. That’s not just a number to me. That’s my circle. My people. And when they believe in something because I do, that means everything.\n    \n      Sure, we all want to win. Nobody’s here to lose. But for me, this isn’t just about chasing green candles. It’s about building something that holds. Something that reflects the energy, the loyalty, the culture we’ve cultivated. I’m not driven by hype—I’m driven by responsibility. By the look in someone’s eyes when they say, “I’m in because of you.” That’s not something I take lightly.\n    \n      So no, I can’t just “jeet.” I can’t rug, dip, or disappear. Not without bringing down the full force of hail, wrath, and fury from the people I care about most. And honestly? I wouldn’t want it any other way. That pressure—that accountability—is what keeps me sharp. It’s what keeps this real.\n    \n      $LING isn’t just a play. It’s a promise. A promise that we’re building with intention. That we’re not here to flip and vanish—we’re here to create something that echoes. And when you’ve got your own community riding with you, you don’t just chase profit. You protect the story. You protect the people.\n    \n      That’s what drives me. That’s why I’m here.\n    \n      r/MissingDogHead\n    \n      https://linktr.ee/MissingDogHead",

    "content": "I found $ALLO recently and it stood out because it isn’t trying to sell a dream with hype or memes. The whole idea behind ALLO is pretty straightforward: they want to make funding in crypto more transparent. Right now, grants and funding decisions usually happen quietly in the background, controlled by a few people. $ALLO is trying to move that on-chain so the community can actually see how money is being allocated and who gets funded. No secret committees, no politics, just open rules and transparent funding.\n    \n      This feels like something crypto actually needs, especially as more projects start competing for grants and ecosystem money. It’s still early, which is exactly why I’m watching it. Early usually means more upside if the idea catches on.\n    \n      $ALLO also just got listed on Bitget, and there’s a trading event happening where you can earn rewards just from trading. I tried the same event with a different token before and got rewarded without doing anything extra, I just traded like normal and the platform tracked my activity automatically. After that, the reward converted into tokens I could swap for USDT.\n    \n      No hype, no weird hoops to jump through. Just a project trying to solve a real problem, and a chance to earn a little extra while trading.\n    \n      Not financial advice, always DYOR.",

    "content": "I remember first seeing $PEP on my feed and thinking it was just another frog coin. Then I dug deeper. What started as a meme idea quietly evolved into a full-blown Layer-1 blockchain — proof-of-work, forked from Bitcoin and Dogecoin, running its own chain with fast, low-fee transactions. No bridges, no wrappers, no dependence on anyone else’s network.\n    \n      While most coins chase hype on X, the $PEP devs are actually building and promoting. They’ve been attending crypto summits, putting up real banners, and now they’re planning one of the boldest moves yet: a massive Copacabana banner in Rio from December 26 to January 4. Millions of people celebrating New Year’s Eve will see “Pepecoin.org” on one of the most famous beaches in the world.\n    \n      This isn’t a paid influencer stunt — it’s the community making noise the old-school way.  Kraken integration reportedly next. The market cap is still under $40 M, and that’s where it gets interesting.\n    \n      Coins with way less tech and no utility have reached billion-dollar valuations in past cycles. A true L1 chain with this kind of momentum doesn’t need a miracle to 100x just exposure. Every bull run has its breakout Layer-1 story. $PEP might be this cycle’s unexpected one.",

It felt like one of the early projects that could actually go somewhere, so I didn’t mind spending time there. I was also pretty active in their X and Discord, just chatting with people, asking questions, keeping up with updates. Somewhere along the way, Monad sent me one of their cards as appreciation, and that kind of made it feel real, like I was part of something from the ground up.\n    \n      It brought back memories of my older airdrop runs, those days when I’d test random protocols and later find out they turned into big ones. Same kind of patience, same curiosity. So now that $MON is getting close to launch, I’ve been thinking about adding more to my stack. Feels like I’m coming in late this time, but I still grabbed some from bitget premarket before it goes live. Maybe it helps me stay ahead a bit. Still looking around though, just in case there’s another way to get more before it launches.any info about the price prediction?https://coinmarketcap.com/community/search/top/mon/",

The Falcon Foundation actually pre-funds these, so users don’t pay gas when moving stablecoins. That’s huge for reducing friction in everyday transactions.\n    \n      On the market side:Some exchanges, including Bitget, offered pre-market futures for $FAL, giving early participants a way to gauge price before the spot listing.There’s also a launchpool campaign running, which is one of the ways projects often build initial engagement.\n    \n      Whether Falcon can deliver on its stablecoin-focused pitch is still to be seen, but the concept is interesting enough that I’ll be following how it develops.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/falcon-finance-ff/",

    "content": "CMC Link: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/falcon-finance-ff/\n    \n      Been reading a lot here lately about stablecoin projects sneaking into the alt scene, and it made me curious to check out Falcon Finance ($FF). Numbers caught my eye first: apparently over $1.8B USDf circulating supply, close to $1.9B TVL, and growing through collateralized debt positions (sort of a CDP play like MakerDAO but with its own twist). That’s not pocket change.\n    \n      With stablecoin issuance booming again this year (USDT up $18B, USDC up $7B), projects like this might be in the right place at the right time. Daily DeFi transactions climbing toward $30B kind of confirm the momentum.\n    \n      Personally, I first stumbled into $FF because of the listing on Bitget I had tried their launchpools before ($0G actually gave me some crazy good returns for just a few days of staking BGB). So when I saw $FF being added, I figured I’d keep an eye on it rather than sleep on another stablecoin/CDP project.\n    \n      Not saying it’s the “next big thing,” but the combo of high TVL, decent track record on issuance, and a CEX listing to provide liquidity definitely makes it one to watch.\n    \n      Anyone else been following $FF before this listing, or am I late to the party?",

    "content": "One thing i have learned in this space is that trading trending tokens is a game of timing. When a token starts picking up momentum, you can almost feel the shift, more chatter, more volume, and suddenly it is on everyone’s radar. That is when i try to step in, but the tricky part is knowing when to exit before the hype dies down.\n    \n      Recently, i managed to catch $HEMI while it was trending. It was not because i had some secret alpha, but just from paying attention to volume spikes and community buzz. The price action lined up with what i was looking for, and it ended up being one of those trades where entering at the right time really made a difference.\n    \n      Of course, i have also been on the other side where i chased too late and ended up holding bags. That is why i try to remind myself not every trend is worth chasing, and risk management matters even when things look like they are mooning.\n    \n      These days, i have been keeping an eye on different ways tokens are traded too. Another tool i use to stay flexible instead of relying only on one type of platform is Bitget onchain\n    \n      At the end of the day, catching a trend feels great, but i think the real key is discipline, knowing when to get in, when to scale out, and being okay if you miss one. Because there is always another trend around the corner.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hemi/",

    "content": "Falcon Finance is positioning itself as a universal collateral infrastructure, enabling users to transform a wide range of liquid assets, whether digital tokens, currency backed assets, or tokenized RWAs, into USD pegged onchain liquidity. The core of the platform revolves around USDf, an overcollateralized synthetic stablecoin backed by diversified yield strategies such as basis spreads, funding rate arbitrage, cross exchange opportunities, and native staking.\n    \n      Alongside it, the protocol also offers sUSDf, a yield bearing version of USDf designed for long term holders. It provides exposure to institutional grade strategies while rewarding participants with boosted APY tiers when they commit to fixed term locks. This structure aims to balance stability with consistent returns for users seeking more than just basic arbitrage gains.\n    \n      The native token, $FF, anchors the ecosystem by granting access to governance, staking rewards, and community incentives, as well as unlocking exclusive platform features. With Bitget already giving the project notable attention, I think that visibility could translate into stronger market activity around $FF, as exchange support often plays a key role in liquidity depth and broader adoption.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/falcon-finance-ff",

For those tracking its market debut, Bitget was one of the exchanges that offered early trading via pre-market futures, providing a decent gauge of initial price discovery before the full spot launch and an ongoing launchpool campaign.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/plasma-xpl/",

    "title": "How $BGB and Bitget Launchpools Are Saving My Crypto Portfolio in This Market Downturn.",
    "content": "I've been knee-deep in the crypto trenches for years now, riding the waves of volatility like most of us here. But let me tell you, the last 7 days have been a bloodbath for my portfolio literally 99.9% of my holdings tanked over 20% each, leaving me staring at a sea of red that could make even the most seasoned HODLer sweat. The one saving grace? $BGB. This token has been my portfolio's lifeline, stubbornly holding onto green territory while everything else crumbled. It's a reminder of why I diversified into utility tokens like BGB in the first place they're built for stability in ecosystems like Bitget, and right now, it's the only thing keeping my overall balance from total annihilation.\n    \n      That said, I'm not just sitting back and hoping for a miracle; I've been actively farming launchpools to claw back some gains, and the timing couldn't be better. The $0G launchpool came through clutch, pumping out solid returns that softened the blow from my other positions and gave me some much-needed breathing room. Now, with $XPL kicking off again, I'm going all in on this one staking everything I've got into it. The reward pool is a hefty 2,200,000 XPL, and based on the last run where the listing price surged 60% and APY hit an impressive 67%, I'm optimistic this could be another winner. If you're in a similar spot, definitely check it out; these opportunities have been my secret weapon for staying afloat in this brutal market. What's been saving your portfolios lately?\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new/",

    "title": "$XPL Breakout and What Comes Next",
    "content": "Yesterday $XPL just broke out with a sharp +24% move, lifting from its consolidation base under $0.90 into the $1+ zone with strong backing from both volume and open interest. It was the kind of breakout that shows real strength after weeks of accumulation, and now the main question is whether that momentum can hold.\n    \n      The range around $0.95–1.00 is where the real test sits. If buyers can defend it and flip it into support, that zone becomes the launchpad for another leg higher. A retest of $1.50 isn’t far-fetched if momentum continues to build, and the structure suggests that the move isn’t just a one-off spike but a trend trying to form.\n    \n      While I’m watching price action closely, I’m also considering other ways to stay positioned. Using Bitget Launchpool to earn extra XPL on the side while waiting for the next price hike feels like a way to keep exposure working for me without forcing trades. In a volatile market, having both the chart momentum and passive accumulation running together can make a big difference.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/plasma-xpl/",

    "content": "The recent airdrop played a big role by bringing in huge participation and pushing volumes higher than usual. Looking at the rise of close to 19% in the past 24 while the broader market has barely moved made me start looking for what might be the trigger. And in the process, I realized that the PA is being shaped mainly by its fresh listing on exchanges together with activity on DEX platforms like PancakeSwap and the phase 19 onchain challenge on bitget which has given it more liquidity and real trading flow while reflecting how traders are jumping into it for rewards.\n    \n      From a technical view the setup still leans positive, which has pushed above key averages and cleared the 0.05 level but resistance around 0.068 is acting as a cap. Breaking through there could open a path toward 0.09 while slipping under 0.04 would put pressure back on the trend.\n    \n      Right now the mix of exposure strong DEX activity and technical momentum is the main thing affecting XCX price today. The next thing to DYOR is if it can hold above 0.055 once the noise from the airdrop starts to fade.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xeleb-protocol",

    "content": "What is Aster?\n      Here’s what I found from CoinMarketCap and Aster’s docs:\n    \n        \n      \n      Aster is a next-gen decentralized exchange with both Spot and Perpetual trading. It aims to be an on-chain hub for global crypto traders. (CoinMarketCap)\n    \n    \n      \n      It supports “Simple Mode” for one-click, MEV-free execution, and “Pro Mode” with features like hidden orders, grid trading, and 24/7 stock perpetuals. (CoinMarketCap)\n    \n    \n      \n      Allows using liquid staking tokens (e.g. asBNB) or yield-generating stablecoins (USDF) as collateral. Good for capital efficiency. (CoinMarketCap)\n    \n    \n      \n      Built on “Aster Chain”, a high-performance, privacy-focused Layer 1. The project is backed by YZi Labs. (CoinMarketCap)\n    \n    \n      Key Stats\n        \n      \n      Price: ~$1.35 USD (volatile, seems like it’s had a big move recently) (CoinMarketCap)\n    \n    \n      \n      Market Cap: ~$2.24B (CoinMarketCap)\n    \n    \n      \n      Circulating Supply: ~1.65B ASTER of 8B total (CoinMarketCap)\n    \n    \n      \n      24h Volume: High—around $1.2B — shows there’s real trading activity. (CoinMarketCap)\n    \n    \n      What I Like — Upside Potential\n        \n      \n      The mix of DEX + Perp + cross-chain support (BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum) gives it flexibility and access to big liquidity pools.\n    \n    \n      \n      Using yield/staking / stablecoin collateral adds utility beyond just trading. That kind of capital efficiency can attract sophisticated traders.\n    \n    \n      \n      The upside if the simple & pro modes attract large volumes, plus if the chain’s performance and privacy features are solid.\n    \n    \n      Risks / What to Watch Out For\n        \n      \n      It’s still early: L1 chains are tough to launch and maintain. Network stability, security, adoption, and competition matter.\n    \n    \n      \n      Regulatory risk: Perpetuals & derivatives are often under higher regulatory scrutiny.\n    \n    \n      \n      Competition is stiff: Many projects are doing DEX + perp trading + multi-chain. Aster needs to differentiate well and deliver.\n    \n    \n      \n      Tokenomics and unlock schedule / dilution risk—whenever supply is large (8B max) you need to see how tokens are released.\n    \n    \n      My Take\n      I see ASTER being a promising Moonshot. If they execute well, especially on adoption of both spot & perp over multiple chains, there’s likely significant upside. Personally I’m considering a small position to ride the potential, but only after I double-check token unlocks & roadmap delivery.\n    \n      If you want to check it out, here’s my invite link (we both get rewards if you join via this):https://www.asterdex.com/en/referral/47Gc3iInvite code: 47Gc3i",

    "content": "One of the most interesting things to watch in crypto is how a token reacts when it gets listed on a major exchange. It is almost like a stress test for the project. Suddenly, liquidity improves, more traders can access it, and the spotlight gets a little brighter.\n    \n      Usually, the first thing you will see is a spike in price and volume. A lot of that is just hype, new eyes jump in, and early holders sometimes use the liquidity to take profits. After that initial wave, tokens often settle down and find a new real market value. In some cases, that value holds higher than before because of the increased exposure, while in other cases the hype fades quickly.\n    \n      Recently, $AVNT which was listed on Bitget like many tokens, it had that initial pop when trading opened, and then traders started testing the waters to see where the fair price should be. It is a reminder that exchange listings do not automatically mean long term growth, but they do matter for accessibility and legitimacy.\n    \n      For long term holders, listings are more about trust and network effects. A token that is available on a big exchange is easier to trade, easier to follow, and often taken more seriously by the broader market. For short term traders, it is usually about riding the volatility and volume that comes with the news.\n    \n       When you see a token get listed on a major exchange, do you treat it as a trading opportunity, a long term signal, or just hype to be cautious about?\n    \n       https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avantis/",

    "content": "One of the biggest challenges in crypto is that most blockchains are built differently, which makes it hard for them to talk to each other. That is where the idea of a universal protocol comes in, a system designed to give every chain access to the same advanced tools without needing to rebuild everything from scratch.\n    \n      Zero Knowledge (ZK) tech is one of those tools. ZK proofs make it possible to verify information without exposing all the details, which can improve both privacy and scalability. Imagine every blockchain, no matter how it was built, being able to tap into ZK for faster and more secure transactions. That is the vision behind this universal protocol.\n    \n      The interesting part is that the token connected to this, $ZKC, just got listed on some centralized exchanges, including Bitget. It shows there is growing recognition of the idea, but of course, listings alone are not enough, it is the adoption of the tech that will really matter in the long run.\n    \n      If this kind of universal protocol works as intended, it could reduce the fragmentation we see today and give developers more flexibility. Wanted to know what the community thinks, do you see ZK becoming a standard layer across all chains, or will it remain something only a few ecosystems adopt deeply?\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/boundless/",

    "content": "With new altcoins, timing often matters as much as the listing itself. When Avantis ($AVNT) first went live, early access on exchanges like Bitget gave traders the chance to buy under $0.20. Over the next few days, momentum carried the token above $1.40. By the time other exchanges opened trading, the market had already priced in much of that early move.\n    \n      This isn’t unusual, as CEX like Binance often waits until liquidity builds before listing, but it highlights how early exchange access can create very different entry points. For $AVNT, those early moves turned into outsized gains for first movers.\n    \n      The broader takeaway is that altcoin traders may need to balance the upside of chasing early listings with the stability and depth that come when major exchanges finally step in. Sometimes the biggest opportunities happen before the “big” listing day.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avantis/",

    "content": "Avantis ($AVNT) has become one of the more notable Base-native projects to watch after its recent launch and multi-exchange listings and others. At its core, Avantis is a perpetuals DEX, but it stands out for two reasons.\n    \n      The first is its zero-fee perpetuals model, where fees are only charged if trades are profitable. That’s a departure from the way most DEXs and CEXs operate, and it raises interesting questions about sustainability and liquidity incentives. The second is its focus on real-world asset (RWA) markets. Beyond crypto, Avantis is offering synthetic exposure to commodities, forex, and equities—with leverage that rivals centralized platforms (500× for crypto and 1000× for forex).\n    \n      Backing from Pantera and Coinbase Ventures, along with billions in early trading volume, suggest that Avantis is aiming to position itself as infrastructure rather than just another altcoin. While launch events such as the PoolX where users stake ETH on Bitget are helping to drive initial liquidity and adoption.\n    \n      The question for altcoin traders is whether $AVNT can sustain momentum beyond the listings, or if its unique design choices truly give it an edge in the long run.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avantis/",

    "title": "Why High Utility Projects Like Oracles and $SWTCH Matter",
    "content": "One part of crypto that does not always get enough attention is high utility projects, especially oracles. They play a key role by acting as secure bridges between real world data and the blockchain. Without oracles, things like DeFi lending rates, stablecoin pegs, and even prediction markets would not function properly. They are basically the invisible infrastructure that keeps everything transparent and reliable.\n    \n      At the same time, it is interesting to see how communities are experimenting with their own tokens. For example, $KENDU is a community driven token that shows how people can rally around a shared idea while still exploring utility. It might not be an oracle itself, but it is part of the wider ecosystem where communities are testing what tokens can actually achieve beyond speculation.\n    \n      On the exchange side, listings are also reflecting this trend. Just recently, $SWTCH, another project in the infrastructure space, was listed on Bitget. It is a small detail, but it shows that exchanges are starting to give more visibility to tokens tied to building actual functionality in crypto.\n    \n      In the end, i think the balance between high utility infrastructure projects like oracles and community driven tokens like $KENDU is what makes the space exciting. Some keep the system running, others bring people together,  and both are needed for the ecosystem to grow.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/switchboard-protocol/",

    "content": "Oracles don’t get as much attention as L1s or meme coins, but they’re arguably just as critical for DeFi. If price feeds or data streams fail, the whole system breaks. Chainlink has been the default solution for years, but newer competitors are starting to expand.\n    \n      One example is Switchboard (SWTCH). Launched on Solana in 2021, it now supports 10+ chains including Arbitrum, Optimism, Aptos, Sui, and It was also recently listed on Bitget. What makes it different is the emphasis on programmable and customizable data feeds, developers can design their own oracle setups instead of relying on pre-packaged ones. It also adds extras like verifiable randomness and decentralized storage.\n    \n      The interesting part is whether multi-chain support and flexibility give Switchboard enough room to stand out, or if the oracle space will stay dominated by a single provider.\n    \n      Do you see projects like this gaining traction, or is there only room for one “default” oracle in crypto?\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/switchboard-protocol/",

    "content": "Over time I have learned that the way I approach tokens keeps changing. At first, I was only focused on the price chart, trying to catch entries and exits. But lately, I have started to notice how some projects push me to think a bit wider, not just about what I can make from a trade but also how I can position myself while things are still forming.\n    \n      That’s how I’ve been looking at $PTB. When it launched I didn’t pay it much mind beyond curiosity. But as I kept checking the numbers, the picture started to shift. I saw it closing a day with a price around $0.0256, and now it’s sitting around $0.0537.  a 109% move already, and even though numbers on their own don’t tell the full story, they do have a way of catching my attention.\n    \n      The other layer is the launchpool on bitget, where the APR has been holding above 50%. And that creates a different kind of thinking. It is not just about watching if the chart can push higher, but also about how I can make use of the staking side while keeping exposure. That balance between trading for quick gains and letting tokens work in the background is something I’ve been experimenting with more often, and $PTB fits neatly into that.\n    \n      It reminds me that trading isn’t static. One token can change how I look at my activities, forcing me to adapt. It might be early still, but moments like this show me why I keep paying close attention. Sometimes the story is in the chart, sometimes it is in the opportunities built around it, and when both come together, it becomes harder to ignore.\n    \n      https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/portal-to-bitcoin",

    "content": "Everyone’s talking about ETH and Solana, but they tend to forget that every cycle, there’s a narrative that sneaks up before it goes mainstream. Lately I’ve noticed how much the BNB ecosystem has been evolving beyond the usual DeFi and meme plays. A lot of their incubation projects are quietly AI-focused, and that caught my attention.\n    \n      From Chaingpt ($CGPT) to MYshell ($SHELL) and now Gata ($GATA). The core idea is a decentralized marketplace for AI training data + compute. Instead of relying on centralized players, they’re trying to crowdsource resources and turn them into something like a distributed AI supercomputer. Their DataAgent, which evaluates the quality of datasets, feels like a practical step forward given how much junk data exists online.\n    \n      It also doesn’t hurt that they’re backed by YZi Labs (ex-Binance Labs). The timing is interesting too since $GATA just listed on exchanges like Bitget and others, which has been hosting a streak of AI and utility-heavy tokens lately. What I find compelling is that this isn’t just a trading narrative, it’s tied to real infrastructure needs in AI.\n    \n      Still, early days. I’d love to hear how others here think about AI x crypto beyond the hype and How do we see BNB resurfacing again\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gata/",

Instead of running on centralized servers, the idea is to distribute model inference across nodes, making it more censorship resistant, cost efficient, and transparent.\n    \n      It’s interesting because it takes the same principles that made DeFi powerful (decentralization, open participation, token incentives) and applies them to AI. Imagine a system where developers, node operators, and end-users all interact in a trustless way, while AI tasks are processed across the network.\n    \n      There are still big challenges, latency, data quality, coordination between nodes, but if this evolves, it could open up a new class of AI + blockchain applications.On a related note, I saw that DecentralGPT ($DGC) is set to be listed on Bitget soon, which could draw more eyes to the decentralized AI narrative.\n    \n      What do you think, are decentralized LLMs just hype right now, or do they have a real shot at becoming a new layer in Web3 infrastructure?\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentralgpt/",

    "content": "One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned in this space is that not every win comes instantly. Sometimes, you can be doing everything right, researching solid projects, managing your risk, and entering at good levels, and still see little to no movement for a while. That doesn’t mean you made the wrong choice, it often just means the timing isn’t right yet.\n    \n       The market doesn’t always reward you on your schedule. It has its own rhythm, and part of being a successful trader or investor is learning to wait for that rhythm to align with your position.\n    \n      Take BigStrategy Inc $BSTR as an example. For a while, it was only trading onchain. Then, recently, it got listed on Bitget Spot. In this market, a single development will bring more eyes, more liquidity, and more accessibility for traders. Holders who had the patience to sit through the quieter phase suddenly saw a shift in momentum, not because the fundamentals changed overnight, but because the right event happened at the right time.\n    \n       This is why patience and conviction matter. It’s easy to get shaken out when a position isn’t moving, but often the difference between a missed opportunity and a great trade is simply the willingness to wait for the right catalyst.\n    \n      In crypto, your job isn’t just to find good projects, it’s to survive long enough for the market to notice them.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bigstrategy-inc/",

This action underscores the project’s long-term commitment to a sustainable and deflationary token model that enhances value for the entire ecosystem.\n    \n      The burn reflects growing adoption of Serenity’s solutions by corporate and institutional partners, as real-world integration of its products continues to accelerate.\n    \n      Key outcomes of the burn include:• Reduced token supply, increasing potential demand for $SERSH• Reinforced market trust through transparent, deflationary economics• Strengthened momentum ahead of major ecosystem growth milestones\n    \n      This marks the first of multiple planned burns tied to Serenity’s long-term roadmap. With token utility expanding globally, $SERSH remains central to the project’s secure, decentralized infrastructure for digital asset management and inheritance.\n    \n      As Serenity scales, $SERSH is built to scale with it.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/",

    "content": "It’s wild how fast the space moves. Just when you think you’ve seen it all, perp DEXs built specifically for meme coins start popping up, and honestly, it kind of makes sense.We’ve already seen how meme tokens like $DOGE, $PEPE, and countless others can drive insane volume, attention, and volatility. So why not create dedicated places where traders can long, short, and speculate on these assets with more precision?\n    \n      Meme focused perp DEXs are tapping into this momentum by building platforms that cater directly to degens and casual traders alike, aiming for smooth user experience, quick execution, and less of the complicated setup that comes with traditional DeFi trading. Whether you're farming microcaps or chasing momentum plays, having the ability to trade perps on memes changes the game a bit.\n    \n      Some of these DEXs are still early, but the trend is growing. And with Bitget set to list Superp ($SUP), a token tied to this niche, it shows that the narrative is starting to catch wider attention.Will these platforms become the standard for meme trading? Time will tell. But if you’re already trading meme coin, keeping an eye on this perp DEX wave might not be a bad idea. Just remember to manage your risk, it’s all fun and games until the charts go vertical. the wrong way.\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/superp/",

Wasn’t thinking too much about it… until bitget suddenly announced the listing. That's when i decide to think maybe this token belongs where the real volume is. A place where you can test momentum when the market moves.\n    \n      They were no word yet on any event or campaign, but with how this exchange usually does these things, I’ll give it some few days to see if they announce something.

I’m considering a small position soon and if I do, I’ll probably use bitget candybomb to grab some extra rewards on the side. since everything is lookin like the chart is trying to create a perfect entry point for me. DYOR let's look deep into this.https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alliance-games",

    "content": "$COA powers the Alliance Games ecosystem, a growing GameFi project aiming to bridge traditional gaming with Web3. They're working on things like cross-game NFTs, player rewards, and community-driven economies. The token itself is meant to support governance, in-game utilities, and marketplace transactions within their ecosystem.\n    \n      What caught my attention today is that $COA is getting listed on BingX, yeah, it just went live. I know exchange listings aren’t always a big deal, but for early-stage tokens like this, it usually brings more eyes and liquidity. Could be an interesting one to keep on the radar if you’re into GameFi or early token listings.\n    \n      Not financial advice, of course.

The whole “Grok Companion” angle caught people fast, a 3D goth-anime AI linked into xAI’s chatbot that actually talks to you. Kind of wild.\n    \n      Back then, it felt like another playful memecoin experiment, but with a surprisingly cohesive vibe. Fast-forward, and now $ANI’s on Bitget Spot. That’s a big jump, and one that other tokens like $RFC and $HOUSE made too before going on solid runs.\n    \n      The price trend’s been strong, even post-listing, which isn’t always the case. It’s rare to see a memecoin that holds momentum past its debut hype. This one seems to be following through, likely because the community isn't just memeing, they’re actively pushing the anime-AI narrative.\n    \n      I’m curious how far this can stretch. If $ANI follows the path of $Launchcoin or even $RFC post-spot, there might still be a lot of room left. Anyone else here been tracking it since the Onchain phase? What’s your take on these kinds of hybrid projects that blend culture and AI?\n    \n      Let’s talk, are we just scratching the surface on AI-narrative tokens?\n    \n      https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ani-grok-companion",

    "content": "I've been scouting micro-cap gems on the Tron network lately, the kind with market caps under 10M that can explode if some real volume rolls in. You get it - those degenerate plays where timing is everything, but fees kill the vibe. Every swap, transfer, or contract call drains energy like crazy, and if I stake a ton of TRX to build up resources, that's capital stuck that I could use for jumping into more positions. It's frustrating when you're trying to flip quick without bleeding out on costs.\n    \n      Last week, I got fed up and tested renting energy from tr.energy. Super straightforward: punch in your wallet address, choose a rental period - I went with 24 hours to keep it short - drop a handful of TRX as payment, and boom, the energy shows up in your account in less than a minute. No hassle, no waiting around. I ran a bunch of USDT transfers for three different token flips that day, and it cut my costs by around 60% compared to burning energy outright. Best part? Zero KYC nonsense, no locking up your funds long-term, and it doesn't mess with anything on-chain - just a quick boost to your resources so you can trade freely.\n    \n      It's a game-saver for low-volume stuff where you don't want to commit big. Before this, I'd burn through extra TRX or skip trades altogether. Now, I can hit those sketchy micro-caps without second-guessing fees. You guys rent energy like this for your degen hunts, or do you have other tricks? What's your go-to hack for dodging fees on those high-risk, low-MC coins? Share if you've got something better - curious if there's a free option or something I missed",

    "content": "Not gonna lie, this market’s been keeping me on the sidelines lately — it’s either FOMO bait or complete crickets. But I recently took a shot at $CROSS which I’ve been lowkey watching for a bit now. The whole idea of a player-owned, on-chain gaming economy where in-game items are actually tradable just makes sense to me. Like, if gaming is gonna evolve, it’s probably going to look something like this, more ownership, less walled gardens.\n    \n      What I like about CROSS is that it’s not trying to reinvent the wheel with hype, it’s building its own L1 chain for games, but keeping it EVM-compatible, fast, and cheaper to use. From what I’ve read, they’re also doing things like plug-and-play SDKs for devs, and making it easier for regular gamers to interact with blockchain without all the friction.\n    \n      I recently saw they got listed on Bitget, which came with a zero gas deposit deal. Not gonna pretend that’s the main reason I jumped in, but it definitely made it easier to test the waters. I had a small bag sitting idle and figured, why not?\n    \n      Curious if anyone else has looked into the actual tech behind it? Like, is it mostly PvE games, or are there PvP/competitive titles in the works? Also wondering how sustainable the rewards/gov side is in the long run.\n    \n      Would love to hear what others think.

    "content": "Moonveil is an innovative Web3 gaming ecosystem built on a custom Layer-2 blockchain that leverages zkEVM technology and Polygon CDK to support mid-core games through a modular infrastructure. It aims to provide seamless cross-game identity and asset interoperability with low friction for both developers and gamers. The ecosystem is powered by the native token $MORE, which acts as a unified gas token across the chain and offers utility within the various games and the broader platform economy.\n    \n      Moonveil also implements a loyalty and badge system called “Moon Beams” alongside incentivized programs designed to engage users early through airdrops and node-sale rewards. The project targets mid-core gamers with multiple titles including Astrark, a tower defense game; Bushwhack, a stealth battle royale; Flaming Pets, a multiplayer on-chain mini-game spanning 25 castles; as well as several casual mini-games. The Layer-2 chain features support for ZK scaling, wallet abstractions, and data availability mechanisms to reduce gas friction and improve user experience.\n    \n      Key features of Moonveil include its modular zkEVM Layer-2 built on Polygon CDK, which enables a scalable, customizable environment for building games while maintaining security through zero-knowledge proofs and ensuring low gas costs. Players benefit from cross-game asset portability, allowing them to carry their identities, NFTs, and items between games such as Astrark, Bushwhack, and Flaming Pets, thereby enhancing engagement and retention. The Flaming Pets game serves as an initial testbed to showcase the performance and user experience of the Layer-2 chain. Beyond marketplace transactions, $MORE facilitates cross-platform trading, enabling seamless exchange of assets between different games and applications within the Moonveil ecosystem. Additionally, players can use $MORE to unlock premium content, access exclusive events, and enhance gameplay modes, which boosts engagement while rewarding active participation.\n    \n      $MORE is set to be listed on Bitget Exchange on June 27, and to celebrate, Bitget is hosting the Moonveil x Bitget $MORE Token Special Campaign. New users can participate by downloading the Bitget app and registering exclusively through a link, completing KYC, and becoming eligible to receive between 50 to 200 $MORE tokens from a prize pool of 1,800,000 $MORE. The promotion runs from June 24, 10 AM UTC to July 11, 10 AM UTC.\n    \n      https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moonveil",

These are problems that have hindered Bitcoin’s mainnet use, especially for things beyond just holding or transferring value.\n    \n      From what’s I have seen in their whitepaper, B2 is about 50x cheaper and 300x faster than the Bitcoin mainnet. It’s also built with added functionality that’s meant to make development on Bitcoin easier and more scalable. The total token supply is 210,000,000, and the ticker is simply $B2.\n    \n      So If you're looking into new utility-focused projects, this one might be worth checking out.

    "content": "KENDU: The Meme Coin That Refused to Die Is Now Building an RPG With a Triple AAA Game Developer?!\n    \n      🔗 LadyTrader X Space Recording\n    \n      Okay, so massive shout out to u/barnickal for taking detailed notes of the most recent Kendu X Space! Also a huge shout out to LadyTraderRA for hosting this awesome X Space! I took his bullet-points and made it into this summary. It's a must listen, and after the latest updates from the April 21st community call, it’s honestly wild how far Kendu has come. If you're expecting another pump-and-dump meme token, you're not paying attention. Kendu is no longer a gamble. It’s a movement.\n    \n      From Dev Rug to Community Resurrection\n    \n      Let’s rewind for a second. Kendu should have been dead months ago. The original developer rugged 5% of the supply and bailed, right as the market was crashing and liquidity was being sucked into Trump-themed meme coins. That would have been the end for most projects. But not here. The community rallied, kicked the bad actor out, and kept building. Not only did Kendu survive, it started thriving.\n    \n      Kendu Games: AAA Dev Comes Out of Retirement\n    \n      This is the biggest news. Coop, a community member, is now launching a legitimate game studio under the $KENDU umbrella, named; Kendu Games. Not a half-baked crypto game or a easy cash-grab. A full-scale traditional RPG, with serious developers. The lead dev? A former triple AAA game developer and BioWare veteran who worked on Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and Baldur’s Gate. He literally came out of retirement for this, purely because he believes in what Kendu is doing. The plan is to create a Skyrim-style RPG, followed by a roguelite later. No crypto gimmicks in the gameplay. But the kicker is that game profits will be used to buy Kendu tokens and fund the community. Here's a small breakdown, from all the profits 10% will go into a Kendu Games Business treasury and 5% will be donated to the Kendu Community wallet. let's say they hit one million copies sold, which is likely to happen, that’s an estimated $1.6 million in buy pressure for Kendu. That’s just from one game.\n    \n      Kendu Games X Profile\n    \n      Decentralized Brand, Real-World Impact\n    \n      Kendu isn’t just building in digital spaces. The brand is exploding in the real world too. Members of the community have launched Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy Drinks, Kendu Vodka, Kendu Nights (club promotions), and even Kendu Esports, a League of Legends team. What makes this different from every other project? It’s all permissionless. Anyone can build under the Kendu brand without needing to ask for approval. There is no centralized entity handing out licenses. This is decentralized brand ownership in action.\n    \n      \"We Don’t Gamble, We Work\"\n    \n      This has become the core philosophy of Kendu. The project isn’t about flipping tokens or hoping for pumps. It’s about showing up and putting in the work. Token holders treat Kendu like a startup. There are daily goals, power hours, and people grinding social content and launching real-life products. The Kendu community is working, not speculating.\n    \n      No Paid Hype, No Insiders\n    \n      One of the most refreshing parts of Kendu is how it’s grown. There are no paid influencers, no whales with insider allocations, and no VC dumping risk. Everyone buys with their own money. Everyone contributes with their own effort. It’s raw, organic, and surprisingly effective. The project has reached over 18,000 holders this way. Not through hype, but through work.\n    \n      Wormhole Bridge: Building for the Long Game\n    \n      Kendu has also quietly launched bridges to the Solana and Base chains. This wasn’t a PR stunt or hype strategy. It was a tactical move, preparing for the moment when momentum returns. The goal is simple: dominate the top gainers list across multiple chains in the long term. This kind of forward-thinking infrastructure sets Kendu apart from typical meme coins. And the cool addition to this; let's say Solana moves up in price? This will automatically drive the price of $KENDU without any added buy pressure.\n    \n      \n    \n      No Roadmap, Just Vision\n    \n      Kendu isn’t promising the moon on a whiteboard full of deadlines. There’s no traditional roadmap. Instead, the focus is on empowering the community to launch initiatives organically. A white paper is currently being written, but it’s meant to lay out a vision, not a list of promises. A grants program is also planned for the future, once the project hits a market cap between $50 million and $100 million. That funding will help support community-led ventures like festivals, shops, or new product lines.\n    \n      Different From Other Meme Coins\n    \n      Kendu isn’t trying to be the next dog-themed token or celebrity-endorsed project. It’s more serious than the average meme coin, more decentralized than celebrity tokens like TrumpCoin, and not botted, but entirely organically build, by REAL human beings. Kendu is trying to build something new, a culture-powered brand that can live in both crypto and the real world.\n    \n      The Builders Speak\n    \n      The people behind Kendu aren’t shy about what they’re building. Josh, one of the core community leads, says he’s never seen a project with this much promise. He points out that Kendu has matched the social output of projects 20 times its size. Kevin, another day-one supporter, compares the project’s vibe to Silicon Valley in the 80s, MTV culture in the 90s, and the early internet boom. It’s culture, investing, and creativity all rolled into one.\n    \n      Josh: ''I've never seen a project with so much promise before. Kendu should really be dead right now – but the community has kept it alive and actually growing. We frequently match the social output of projects 20x our size like MOG, PEPE, and SHIB. Kendu is insanely undervalued considering our output right now – and the morewe grow, the faster that output will scale.''\n    \n      Kevin: ''The stickiness of the community is what made my eyebrows raise from the start. You can't build to 18,000 holders from hype alone – it’s people working 24/7. In crypto, you can join a 'company' like Kendu and actually contribute to it, build with it, and own part of it. That’s never existed before. We are severely undervalued at $10m. We’re going to billions.''\n    \n      Jeff (Co-Host): ''KENDU is legit looking like the early days of SHIB but without the dev drama risk now. It’s more of a decentralised brand incubator than a meme coin at this point. If KENDU Games delivers even medium success, it could be absolutely massive for the tokenomics. Right now it's sitting at a tiny $10m market cap, massively undervalued compared to the ecosystem we’re building.''\n    \n      TL;DR\n    \n      Kendu should’ve died after bad choices by the developer and a market crash. Instead, the community kicked into overdrive, launching real-world products, bridging to new chains, and now even building a AAA-style RPG with a retired BioWare dev. It’s not a meme coin anymore — it’s a decentralized brand, built by people who work, not gamble. And at just $10 million market cap, the whole thing still feels massively undervalued.\n    \n      $KENDU CA:\n    \n      ETH - 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18\n    \n      SOL - 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45\n    \n      BASE - 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n    \n      And with that being said; /KENDU_IS_COMMUNITY\n    \n      CG: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inu\n    \n      CMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/",

The tokens accrue yields automatically via the Babylon protocol, giving a way to use Bitcoin without having to relinquish ownership.\n    \n      Right now, the pre-deposit phase for $PUMPBTC is live, meaning early participants can start staking. Bitg3t is also running a zero gas fee deposit event, making it easier to get involved without extra transaction costs.\n    \n      It’s an interesting shift—Bitcoin moving beyond just holding and into active participation in DeFi.

    "title": "Why now is the easiest time to position yourselves in strong communities - $KENDU is making waves",
    "content": "you might think this recent marking tanking from the last couple months has been increasingly difficult, but I would argue the opposite case\n    \n      The great cleansing of DeFi is what has occurred and its made it easy to identify the true and committed communities dedicated to winning this cycle. The cabal coins or the coins that were valuated much higher than their worth have since been culled with what has happened. There are fewer rugs and a lower chance of getting burned which means your odds of finding a serious committed project are up. Through this darkness there has been a select few communities that with their work have stood out and one of those is Kendu.\n    \n      An unwavering and dedicated community that has shone through the dark market. One that has not stopped building and has kept adding holders even with eth managing to stay below 2000 for weeks on end. A community that builds when the market fear/greed index is at 10 is a community that you want to be holding when that index is at 90.\n    \n      It really feels like we have seen the worst behind us now for the market in general. The bullrun will slowly turn back on in the next couple weeks to months before completely going parabolic once again to new ATHs. So then therefore now is the perfect time to position yourself in strong communities and there is simply no contender when it comes to IRL marketing like Kendu does.\n    \n      We are currently on our 6th day of green and are not stopping. Sell pressure has ceased existing, all the early whales have made their way out and now with a distribution that rivals the top memecoins in the space we are perfectly set up to make a run. We have moved about 80% on the 7-day timeframe right now and are showing no signs of stopping. So, with a clearly established floor and proving through the market culling that we are here to stay and dominate this cycle, it just makes sense to join in on this movement.\n    \n      This simply put is a global behemoth currently larping as a 12m mc coin. We have so much alpha popping up at all times from a decentralised community of dedicated holders that is hard to capture in one post.\n    \n      Many of those holders are only Kendu holders as well meaning that this is THE play for many of us. When you have people who hold only one coin, you have people that are completely and utterly dedicated to a cause. Remember, sustainable mindshare is perpetual. You cannot contain a decentralised community, and I am sure many of you have seen Kendu in the past. So then ask yourself - If you have been seeing Kendu continuously build and grow on the daily for over a year now, sincerely proving Kendu is never stopping, what do you think will happen when eth is ripping through new ATHs?\n    \n      There is only upside.\n    \n      The cope will be palpable when you see Kendu running to multibillions valuation, so buy a bag to avoid lifelong chronic pain of missing \"the one\"\n    \n      This is the final play.\n    \n      r/KenduInu_Ecosystem\n    \n      ETH CA: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18SOL CA: 2nnrviYJRLcf2bXAxpKTRXzccoDbwaP4vzuGUG75Jo45BASE CA: 0xef73611F98DA6E57e0776317957af61B59E09Ed7\n    \n      CG: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kendu-inuCMC: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kendu-inu/",

This project goes beyond the typical meme token concept, weaving an artistic and emotional narrative into its foundation, making it a community-driven movement with a unique twist.\n    \n      Built on BSC, $BUBB benefits from fast transaction speeds of just three seconds per block and ultra-low fees, often costing only a few cents per transaction. This makes it highly practical for trading and transfers, especially when compared to high-gas networks that can be costly for small-scale transactions.\n    \n      Adding to its growing momentum, $BUBB is now officially listed on Bitget, providing wider access and increased liquidity for traders and supporters alike. As more people embrace this project, it continues to carve out a space where art, crypto, and community intersect.

Is this how to trade memecoin? I mostly know meme trading is based on luck and being early which is why I am glad for quickly take the right decision. I rushed to X to celebrate my earning only to see replies that some people made over that on Vine, another token quickly spotted by the exchange.

    "title": "Why you should buy the first Gala Dog memecoin on GalaChain - $GDOG",
    "content": "The chain is new with almost no volume yet (good thing to be this early) and it's clear Gala Games want their project to exceed. GalaDog $GDOG was the first community token that launched and bonded on their new launchpad/dex, and it also happens to be the first dog meme on a new chain. We all know what that means. Because of this and them already promoting this coin I'm willing to bet they'll pump a ton of money into this in order to try and bring people over from other ecosystems, they've already compared it saying its the next solana. I noticed the ceo launched his own coin, bene, and the same address also bought a ton of $GDOG tokens on their launchpad before it graduated to the dex. The team behind the coin are posting on twitter about some game assets theyre building and looks like they plan to do a NFT drop to holders based on their website. Take all this info and it's clear they're going to send this token.\n    \n      The token has a marketcap of 200k currently, and a 100x is only 20m marketcap. Imagine if this does the bare minimum any other chain has done for a dog coin, 200m-2b marketcap would be a 1000x-10,000x and the funniest part is it's not even unrealistic. This feels so early it's almost too good to be true but I'm thinking it's true.\n    \n      I've wrote a buying guide below, the second option you can use a debit card and its a little faster.\n    \n      Option 1:\n    \n      If you already have Metamask, buy $GALA on ethereum. Head to https://connect.gala.com/ connect your wallet and bridge your $GALA from Ethereum -> GalaChain. Once you've done that, you can click on your balances to see. It takes about 1-2 minutes. Once your $GALA is on GalaChain, go to https://swap.gala.com/GALA/GDOG and connect your wallet and swap your gala for $DOG\n    \n      Option 2:\n    \n      Head to https://connect.gala.com/?viewProduct=66a8ed9e4d218b9606182ea7 and connect your wallet. You can purchase $GALA already on GalaChain with a debit card directly to your Metamask wallet. Once you've done that, you can click on your balances to see. It takes about 1-2 minutes. Once your $GALA is on GalaChain, go to https://swap.gala.com/GALA/GDOG and connect your wallet and swap your gala for $DOG\n    \n      Note: your galachain wallet address is just your ethereum address but with \"eth|\" replacing the \"0x\" in the string of the address\n    \n      Here are their socials, check it out yourself first\n    \n      Discord: https://discord.com/invite/gz43xzqT\n    \n      Twitter: https://x.com/GalaDogCoin\n    \n      Website: https://swap.gala.com/GDOG/GALA",

    "content": "$PEP isn’t just another meme token. It’s a real Layer-1 blockchain, forked from Dogecoin and Bitcoin’s original codebase, using Proof-of-Work with its own miners and network. It’s built on the same foundation that powered BTC and DOGE, meaning it’s a fully independent chain, not a token running on another blockchain.\n    \n      Here’s why this matters 👇 Right now, $PEP’s market cap is under $40 million — absurdly low for a functioning Layer-1. •\tAt $400 Million, that’s a 10× from here. •\tAt $1B, the price would be around $0.01. •\tAt $10B, around $0.10. •\tAnd at $100B (DOGE’s peak level), $PEP would be $1. For a coin with its own network, global community, and growing exchange presence, this isn’t just fantasy, it’s math.\n    \n      What’s fueling the momentum:\n    \n      ✅ MEXC listing live — one of the biggest Tier-1 exchanges already supports PEP.\n    \n      ✅ Kraken confirmed listing — integration in progress (Layer-1 listings take time), but this is huge validation for the chain.\n    \n      ✅ More Tier-1 exchanges next — when one major exchange lists a Layer-1, others usually follow.\n    \n      The community is active worldwide, from Asia to Latin America, and marketing is ramping up fast. PEP is positioning itself as the first true “frog chain” A fusion of meme culture and real blockchain tech.\n    \n      This isn’t a meme anymore.

    "title": "Here's $BJBN: A Solana Token Backing an innovative New Web3 Framework! (Powered by Bun Runtime & Implementing Next-Gen Payments)",
    "content": "Hey Solanauts and fellow Moonshot hunters! You often see crypto projects with tokens and no real tech. Today, I'm bringing you a unique opportunity: Bejibun ($BJBN). This is a low-cap gem on Solana built to power a brand-new backend framework designed specifically for the Web3 future. The team is actively grinding, and their vision for decentralized applications (dApps) and simple blockchain payments is what could make this a genuine moonshot.\n    \n        \n      \n      The Engine: The Bejibun Framework\n    \n    \n      \n      $BJBN isn't just a random meme coin; it's the official token for the Bejibun Framework. This project has real, tangible utility in the developer world. What is it? Bejibun is a Typescript framework designed for backend development, but it runs on something truly special: the Bun Runtime. Why Bun Matters For those who don't know: Bun is the new, revolutionary JavaScript runtime (think a super-charged, next-generation Node.js killer). It’s known for its incredible speed, tiny memory footprint, and superior performance in handling concurrent tasks.\n    \n      2. The Bejibun Vision\n    \n      The developers noticed that many of today's dApps are slow because they still rely on traditional, slow backends, despite being on a fast blockchain like Solana. Bejibun fixes this. By building their framework around Bun, they are giving developers an easy-to-use, powerful toolkit that leverages the speed of Bun and is built from the ground up for native Web3 integration. The goal is to build dApps that are truly fast and fully blockchain-integrated. This isn't just a Whitepaper dream! The framework is already in pre-release with key features already implemented, including:\n    \n        \n      \n      A functioning CLI for easy project setup.\n    \n    \n      \n      Middleware support (the core of the payment system).\n    \n    \n      \n      Full Database support (Migrations, Seeders).\n    \n    \n      \n      Routing, Logging, and Redis integration for caching.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      The Killer Feature: x402 Payments\n    \n    \n      \n      Middleware (Making Crypto Easy) This is the absolute game-changer and the core utility of $BJBN's ecosystem. The team is dedicated to implementing a solution based on x402 payment trends—a new way to think about how applications handle micro-payments on-chain. The Problem They Solve: Integrating crypto payments into an application is currently a headache. It requires complex wallet connections, transaction monitoring, and boilerplate code for different chains. It's too complicated for mainstream adoption. The Bejibun Solution: Router.pay() The team is creating a simple, integrated Payment Middleware to dramatically simplify this process. They are making blockchain payments feel as simple as calling a single function inside a traditional web router.\n    \n      Imagine the simplicity for a developer who wants to accept a payment before serving content: Router.pay(\"0xaddress\", \"$0.01\", \"base-sepolia\").get(\"your-endpoint\", \"YourController@yourFunction\")\n    \n      They are researching and building this to abstract away the complexity. What does this mean for YOU? This middleware will drastically lower the entry barrier for building commercial dApps, membership sites, e-commerce stores, or any application that needs fast, seamless micro-payments on the Solana blockchain. This utility alone gives $BJBN massive long-term value.\n    \n      4. The Token: $BJBN\n    \n        \n      \n      Blockchain: SPL token on Solana. (High speed, low fees—the perfect environment).\n    \n    \n      \n      Where to Buy: The token is currently live and tradable on Pump Swap, Raydium and every other major Dexs.\n    \n    \n      \n      Security & Trust: The team has locked a massive 80 MILLION BJBN tokens using the Streamflow platform until November 2026. This is a huge sign of commitment and stability, showing they are here for the long haul.\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Roadmap & Call to Action\n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n      Active Development: The team is constantly pushing code (check their GitHub activity!). They are also working on CSRF/XSS protection, new command structures, and their own ORM.\n    \n    \n      \n      DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH (DYOR)! This is your chance to get in early on a token that has genuine, powerful tech utility built for the future of Web3. Join the community, follow the development, and feel the speed.

They drop - we collect rewards!\n    \n      They do the heavy lifting and we enjoy along the way 🤓\n    \n      Our approach is creating dozens of LP pairs with other successful projects.

    "content": "Hey everyone, just wanted to share something I stumbled on while browsing Solana projects. There’s a new meme token called $APE that’s starting to pop up across small crypto circles. It’s very early, but the community energy feels authentic... not the usual botted hype.\n    \n      Quick notes: • Ticker: $APE • Chain: Solana • Contract: GiZPKUz7sUPMRmC2sKeFywH8mL6jzpWMNrt2JNccpump\n    \n      The developer is publicly active on X (Twitter) and frequently engages with the community.”\n    \n      The team has mentioned regular supply-management updates, the website just launched, and it's yet to be listed on cg and cmc. They have big plans including creating an apeswap. Still under the radar and whales yet to get in...\n    \n      The vibe reminds me of early grassroots memes that found their own momentum. No promises, no financial talk — just observing that $APE has a fun culture and creative meme game forming fast. Might be worth watching how it evolves as Solana meme season continues. Anyone else seen this around or joined the chat yet?",

And when they believe in something because I do, that means everything.\n    \n      Sure, we all want to win. Nobody’s here to lose. But for me, this isn’t just about chasing green candles. It’s about building something that holds. Something that reflects the energy, the loyalty, the culture we’ve cultivated. I’m not driven by hype—I’m driven by responsibility.

The whole idea behind ALLO is pretty straightforward: they want to make funding in crypto more transparent. Right now, grants and funding decisions usually happen quietly in the background, controlled by a few people. $ALLO is trying to move that on-chain so the community can actually see how money is being allocated and who gets funded. No secret committees, no politics, just open rules and transparent funding.\n    \n      This feels like something crypto actually needs, especially as more projects start competing for grants and ecosystem money.

I tried the same event with a different token before and got rewarded without doing anything extra, I just traded like normal and the platform tracked my activity automatically. After that, the reward converted into tokens I could swap for USDT.\n    \n      No hype, no weird hoops to jump through.

No bridges, no wrappers, no dependence on anyone else’s network.\n    \n      While most coins chase hype on X, the $PEP devs are actually building and promoting. They’ve been attending crypto summits, putting up real banners, and now they’re planning one of the boldest moves yet: a massive Copacabana banner in Rio from December 26 to January 4. Millions of people celebrating New Year’s Eve will see “Pepecoin.org” on one of the most famous beaches in the world.\n    \n      This isn’t a paid influencer stunt — it’s the community making noise the old-school way.  Kraken integration reportedly next. The market cap is still under $40 M, and that’s where it gets interesting.\n    \n      Coins with way less tech and no utility have reached billion-dollar valuations in past cycles.
