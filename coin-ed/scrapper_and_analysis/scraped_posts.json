    "content": "Most of the market is red. Big caps are bleeding, volume is low, and hype alone isn’t moving anything. That’s why more people are paying attention to small MC projects that actually build instead of promise.\n    \n      $WAVE spent its first month focused on structure and utility. The system generates its own activity through multiple liquidity pools, and that movement returns SOL rewards to holders without needing constant external volume.\n    \n      Here’s what was accomplished in just 30 days:\n    \n      • 20+ liquidity pairs launched • $10.5K total liquidity across the ecosystem • Team wallet blocked from rewards so holders benefit first • New developer added to strengthen the team • Telegram bot tracking total volume across pairs • 4% of supply locked forever • Continuous optimization of the main pair • New reward strategies in development\n    \n      In a red market, consistency and utility matter more than anything. $WAVE is small, active, and built on mechanics that grow over time — a strong base for real upside potential.\n    \n      CA: u3nva3iLGfoy9XgzkT7tYzAKkV2x6AkNqnukGNdFiDF",

    "title": "$MERL Is Showing Strength Amid Market Volatility, But What Could Be Next for Its Move?",
    "content": "$MERL rose 2.44% in the last 24 hours, moving ahead of the broader crypto market. I’ve been watching it after the recent volatility and it started showing some signs of stabilization. Network upgrades, new exchange support, and a short-term technical rebound all seemed to line up, but seeing it move in real time feels different from just reading charts.\n    \n      I decided to trade it on Bitget as part of the Trading Club Championship Phase 17. I’m not chasing anything, just following $MERL, making small moves, and seeing how it behaves. The extra BGB from the challenge is just part of the process, not the reason I’m trading, mostly it’s about watching how it flows in the market.\n    \n      It makes you wonder if setups like this can appear quietly, what else might be forming in the background that most people aren’t noticing?\n    \n      https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/merlin-chain",
